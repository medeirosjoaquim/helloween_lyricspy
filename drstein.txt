1. Dr. Stein
Once they killed his monster when it went into a trap
Now he's making better ones on a higher step
On a warm summer day the doctor went away
To a place where he could make it real
His assistant's hips were nice
So he cloned her once or twice
Now his hips are aching what a deal
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great rock musicians
And their time is right
Sometimes when he's feeling bored
He's calling it a day
He's got his computers and they do it their own way
They mix some DNA, some skina and a certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and grey
Or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Halloween
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great politicians
And their time is right
One night he cloned himself
Put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind and thought "well never mind"
Took a syringe and blew out his life
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become a great possession
And their time is right
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become a great oppression
And their time is right
2. Savage
You hear the people talking you walk the wrong street
Painting all things black and step on your feet
Flabby stomach, styled hair, trousers full of air
Their morality is real ours isn't there
They don't know, no they can't see
Our hearts close to the sun
Different in our hearts filled with
That faith we carry on
They just call us savage
That's what I like to be
Let them call us savage
Cause that's what we like to be
See the people wonder we run in our direction
Let the narrow-minded sleep we better do some action
Across the universe you smell the smell of lies
I'm trying to be the winner not the sacrifice
See them run they know no fun
And look what they have done
In this world full of rules
We look just like fools
I know what they think when I see them lookin' at me
(Savage)
We come close every day to the time table life
So mart they start their backwards fight
I know what they think when I see them lookin' at me
(Savage)
One day they will drop the bomb
Cause it's necessary to show the power
One day they will give a shit on what you say
3. Livin' Ain't No Crime
Come hither to this place and let your mind fly free
For that's the only way how everyone should be
We all need something that we can keep on livin' for
No one needs to tell us what we're doin' anymore
Head on, head on steady - until the end of time
Living, living ready - for livin' ain't no crime
So tell me, aren't we all just one holding the flame
Against al the babbits in this world who build up frames
Some time or tomorrow we will prove them traitors wrong
So make your dreams come true for it mustn't take too long
Head on, head on steady - until the end of time
Living, living ready - for livin' ain't no crime
Now what's the use of living here and what's it worth
Don't ask but throw away your fear this earth
You are here to live don't think you're here to understand
Don't forget you're no one without someone's helping hand
Head on, head on steady - until the end of time
Living, living ready - for livin' ain't no crime
4. Victim Of Fate
The biggest trap I had seen
Wherever you'll go and wherever you'll get to
Evil's all around
My mother's a bitch, my father's a killer
Gettin' paid for a murder
Fightin' and strugglin' the whole day
The only way to survive
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
I had to kill people to save my own life
I don't wanna go to hell
I started at the bottom
I'm heading for the top
I'll never return I'll never go back
To the goddamn part of the town
Headhunters won't get me 'cause I'm not stupid
But this ain't the life I dreamt of
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
What now, lonely man who's standing
In the shadow of the streets?
You're left alone with no helpin' hand beside you
You hide from the daylight living in darkness
You got no friends, you can trust nobody
Except for yourself
The only shade that's beside you
Is the shade of Lucifer
Laughing with a satanic smile
And his friend death sharpens his sickle
You don't wanna die, do you?
But you will
You will
You will burn in hell
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
You will die!
