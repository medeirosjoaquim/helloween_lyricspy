1. Mr. Ego (Take Me Down)
Take me down
To a ground
Just let me feel it
If I let someone down
Please welcome
Him on the loosing side
I shake you off
And make my choice
Don't wanna hear you
Your slimy voice
Please go down, please
I don't wanna feel you around me
Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin' down
I feel that man
On my back
Don't promise any crap
Someone will break your neck
You don't know how
To soak my soul
Let me out
Let me go
Open your eyes
You told nothing but lies
Please go down, please
C'mon, go down with your ego
Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin' down
Let me go ahead, let me go
I will find an explanation
Where's my only deatination
Separated ways now and forever
Is the one and only measure
Tales full of exaggerations
No more manipulations
And I think you are not funny
Your brain is just a bloated dummy
Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin' down
2. Where The Rain Grows
I never looked higher
Than I could see
Never gave less
Than I have given me
The more you have taken
You turned into fakes
I finally know now
Why, for heavens' sake?
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that if someone's made dumb to the core
He would stay like before
So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
Now you call me liar
'Cause you are just the
"Always-have-right-fools-majority"
I think that if someone starved at your side
You'd all turn your back
Won't give any dime
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that if someone's made sad to the core
He would stay like before
So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
I know where the rain grows
I'm Back from where the rain grows
3. Can't Fight Your Desire
He's got the woman
Out Of Your Dreams
You'll never find out
What it all means
But you've got patience
And still believe
That you'll be there
When she will leave
Someone will lose
Somebody's finding
Somebody smiles
Somebody's crying
Can't fight
You can't fight your desire
You can't fight your dreams, yeah
You can't fight your desire
Hold on to your dreams, yeah
So listen hard now
Man you should know
If you're just waiting
Your doubts will grow
You self-believe
Already small
Get up now
You can have it all
Someone will lose
Somebody's finding
Somebody smiles
Somebody's crying
Can't fight
You can't fight your desire
You can't fight your dreams, yeah
Can't fight
You can't fight your desire
Hold on to your dreams, yeah
Someone will lose
Somebody's finding
Somebody smiles
Somebody's crying
Can't fight
You can't fight your desire
You can't fight your dreams, yeah
Can't fight
You can't fight your desire
Hold on to your dreams, yeah
4. Star Invasion
There he's sitting in his cockpit
Out on guard, ten thousand miles from home
Lookin' through his little window
Earth appears as God's blue magic dome
Just a little bit disturbing
Are those coloured spaceships
Closing in
Star Invasion
From behind the sun
Destination
Straight into his face
Seven years they taugh and told him
What to do and how to act right now
He would have to push a button
In his panic he just don't know how
Seems like there's no red alert no more
And so that squirrel wasn't there before
Star invasion
From behind the sun
Complication
Say what can be done?
Near to a thousand-eight squirrels beam aboard and say hello
Puke and shit his control board, dematerialize and steer their ships
Away from earth
Star invasion
Praise the Lord they're gone
Mere pollution
Cleaning up's no fun
Star invasion
First touch with a different kind
Ausser Spesen nix gewesen IIII
Thanks to vaingloryopera for sending these lyrics.
1. Invitation (Intro)
2. Eagle Fly Free
People are in big confusion
they don't like their constitutions
everyday they draw conclusions
and they're still prepared for war
Some can say what's ineffective
some make up themselves attractive
build up things they call protective
well your life seems quite bizarre
In the sky a mighty eagle
doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
on its wings the rainbow's light
it's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free
let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind
follow the sign
together we'll fly someday
Hey, we think so supersonic
and we make our bombs atomic
or the better quite neutronic
but the poor don't see a dime
Nowadays the air's polluted
ancient people persecuted
that's what mankind contributed
to create a better time
In the sky a mighty eagle
doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
on its wings the rainbow's light
it's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free
let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind
follow the sign
together we'll fly someday
3. You Always Walk Alone
When I hold the key to open heaven's door
I will never make the mistake and give it back
when I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late
I will never give it back
There's just one way I see
the way I think it's right for me
you say to me I will repent what I do
if it's right I'll stop before
When I see the light of sun will fade away
And I reveal what I have loved before
it's too late when I can't see the hours I pay
and I reveal what I have loved before
There's just one way I see
the way I think it's right for me
you say to me I will repent what I do
if it's right I'll stop before
The life I try to give is
all I have inside of me
it's one kind of life for me
this music you hear
the strength we have inside is
so much more than you will know
but if you can't see the life around
you'll always walk alone
Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes
see his strong hands
but tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
see the drunk man, try to ask him why
he will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie
there's a fight in his head he cannot win
getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin
You--you cannot hide
You--you cannot describe your feelings inside
The life I try to give is
all I have inside of me
it's one kind of life for me
this music you hear
the strength we have inside is
so much more than you will know
but if you can't see the life around
you'll always walk alone
4. Rise And Fall
Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit
everyone could see him fall
and be sure it's been his last hit
he's never been seen at all
Some dictator felt progressive
and lay down in the sun
but his people were aggressive
they killed him with a gun
Sometimes you're wrong
by some things you have done
you see fate is too strong
nothing's won
no use for a fight
if you're not acting right
you'll be cut down to size
like a lie
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
so better use your brain
A little dragon could spit fire
but never so for something bad
he didn't know the knight's desire
to throw a lance into his head
Romeo loved his Juliet
their parents told them "Stop"
then it all turned out peculiar
he couldn't get it up
And it's all in vain
when you're living with pain
reap not goods you have grown
by your own
feelings you like
disappear overnight
you sip up every grin
free to win
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
you nearly go insane
A spaceman flies the rocket
that takes him to the stars
thinks his wife is in his pocket
but she's strolling 'round in bars
The king of Los Angeles
bought himself a teddy bear
and the queen became shameless
she did it with a chair
Sometimes you're wrong
by some things you have done
you see fate is too strong
nothing's won
no use for a fight
if you're not acting right
you'll be cut down to size
like a lie
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
so better use your brain
5. Dr. Stein
Once they killed his monster when it went into a trap
now he's making better ones on a higher step
On a warm summer day the doctor went away
to a place where he could make it real
his assistant's hips were nice
so he cloned her once or twice
now his hips are aching what a deal
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
lets them run into the night
they become
Sometimes when he's feeling bored
he's calling it a day
he's got his computers and they do it their own way
They mix some DNA, some skina and a certain spray
you can watch it on a laser screen
and the fellow's blue and grey
or sometimes pink and green
just check it out on Halloween
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures. . .
One night he cloned himself
put his brother on a shelf
but when he fell asleep that night
it crept up from behind and thought "well never mind"
took a syringe and blew out his life
6. We Got The Right
Don't turn your head
back to the wall
don't close your eyes
and wait for your fall
If you believe that you know in this time
you've got anything to win
if you believe that you know
then I say, "you'll lose all again"
In this time there's nothing to get for you
you cannot really do what you want
you're a child, a prisoner in your mind
you are a victim of this hopeless time
You better believe all you do has a sense
it's not for nothing
you better believe all the troubles you have
will play you someday
Why don't you help yourself and do the best
put all the bombs back up their builders' ass
why don't you stand up to say who you are
to show the people that paradise is not far
Oh, can't you see we got the right
to look into the future without no need to hide
no, we won't accept what you do
we stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse
oh, can't you see we got the right
to say we are here to see the light
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
We are credulous idiots
and won't understand what they plan
we march with the times
it's what they expect and we do
Why don't you open your eyes
to undercover all of these lies
I think you won't accept this
go oppose with your fist
fight for your rights
Oh, can't you see we got the right
to say we are here to see the light
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
7. Save Us
Too late to call for the priest
he is not here anymore
we look at the age of the beast
and we've seen its vast armies form
hear our call
Please, save us
please, save us
In permanent madness we live
no time for life and for love
to take is the rule, not to give
insanity comes from below
to take us all
Please, save us
please, save us
We believe that the phenomena of nature
are the expression of infinitive intelligence
we express our belief that all forms of life
are manifestations of spirit
and thus, all men are children of God
Far from down below one comes prepared to take us all
waiting for his future and the final call
We stand on the edge of the world
just one step more and we fall
guide us and please take our hands
without you we're weak and alone
hear our call
Please, save us
please, save us
Now!
Save us--from the gods of thunder
Save us--from the dogs of war
Save us--from the creeping nightmares
Save us--from the evil's course
Save us--from our own ignorance
Save us--from the man in black
Save us--from the desolation
Save us--from the hate attack
Save us--oh please
Save us--please save us
Save us--oh please
Save us--now!
8. March Of Time
Hours of lust, hours of tears passing by before my eyes
today, tomorrow, yesterday. . .one life
days of joy, day of sadness come and go to pass me by
a month, a year, one hundred years, they fly
Ohh, one day I will be gone to lead another life
ohh, and this world will stop to turn around with me
'cause
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally
Times of peace, times of fights, constant movement is our life
can't stop no more, not until. . .we die
we long for more. . .eternity, and maybe there's another life
this one is short, no matter how you try
Ohh, but never give up all the hope to lead a good life
no, don't waste your given time to make things worse
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
one without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally
Please, please help me see, the best way to be
make a change and we, live eternally
no more wasted years, no more wasted tears
life's too short to cry, long enough to try
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally
9. I Want Out
From our lives' beginning on
we are pushed in little forms
no one asks us how we like to be
in school they teach you what to think
but everyone says different things
but they're all convinced that
they're the ones to see
So they keep talking and they never stop
and at a certain point you give it up
so the only thing that's left to think is this
I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free
People tell me A and B
they tell me how I have to see
things that I have seen already clear
so they push me then from side to side
they're pushing me from black to white
they're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hear
But don't push me to the maximum
shut your mouth and take it home
'cause I decide the way things gonna be
I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free
There's a million ways to see the things in life
a million ways to be the fool
in the end of it, none of us is right
sometimes we need to be alone
No no no, leave me alone
I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free
10. Keeper Of The Seven Keys
Make the people
hold each other's hands
and fill their hearts with truth
you made up your mind
so do as divined
Put on your armour
ragged after fights
hold up your sword
you're leaving the light
make yourself ready
for the lords of the dark
they'll watch your way
so be cautious, quiet and hark
You hear them whispering
in the crowns of the trees
you're whirling 'round
but your eyes don't agree
will 'o' the wisps
misguiding your path
you can't throw a curse
without takin' their wrath
Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
or all us people forget what we've been
our only hope's your victory
kill that Satan who won't let us be--kill!
You're the keeper of the seven keys
that lock up the seven seas
and the seer of visions said before he went blind
hide them from demons and rescue mankind
or the world we're all in will soon be sold
to the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
You can feel cold sweat
running down your neck
and the dwarfs of falseness
throw mud at your back
Guided by spells
from the old seer's hand
you're suffering pain
only steel can stand
Stay well on your way and follow the sign
fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
the seven seas are far away
placed in the valley of dust heat and sway
You're the keeper of the seven keys
that lock up the seven seas
and the seer of visions said before he went blind
hide them from demons and rescue mankind
or the world we're all in will soon be sold
to the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
Throw the first key into the sea of hate
throw the second key into the sea of fear
throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
and make the people hold each other's hands
the fourth key belongs into the sea of greed
and the fifth into the sea of ignorance
Disease, disease, disease my friend
for this whole world's in devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease my friend
throw the key or you may die
On a mound at the shore of the last sea
he is sitting, fixing your sight
with his high iron voice causing sickness
he is playing you out with delight
man who do you just think you are?
a silly bum with seven stars
don't throw the key or you will see
dimensions cruel as they can be
don't let him suck off your power
throw the key. . .!
An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming, and earth swallowing him away!
You're the keeper of the seven keys
you locked up the seven seas
and the seer of visions can now rest in peace
there ain't no more demons and no more disease
and, mankind, live up, you're free again
yes the tyrant is dead, he is gone, overthrown
you have given our souls back to light

Save us--from the hate attack
Save us--oh please
Save us--please save us
Save us--oh please
Save us--now!
3. Don't Run For Cover
You hide, won't fight
Avoid the daylight
Give in, won't win
No try to make it right
Why don't you stop crying
Stop your painful dying
Why don't you give your life a sense
One game, one aim
But you're always sleeping
One light so bright
In darkness you're creeping
Why don't you use your head
Step out of your warm bed
And stop being on anxious rat
Run - for your destination
Fly - to the sun
Don't give a damn what the people may say
It's like a chain on your leg
When you always look back
If you don't risk anything one day you'll pay
Don't run for cover
Don't cry alone
Make a step on your stairway
One step closer to what you live for
Don't run for cover
Don't throw away
The only chance that you got
To be the fire in a hot life you choose
No pride, no right ?
In your heart is more strength
You know, I know
Your destiny's in your hand
Now you have this time
To survive don't be blind
In this world where so many can't see
Try - to catch the key
Make - that you can see
The light of your life your way to go
So many hearts in these times
Are so cold they can't find
Their own power to win they don't know
Thanks to vaingloryopera for sending these lyrics.
1. Heroes
Look, the homeless on the street
The little shoeblack on his knees
A good heart and the daily fighter
Policemen, gangster and the priest
Wheelchair woman on her feet
Chinese smoker with his dragon lighter
They're all fighting through their lives
Against their enemies
Reaching out for the light
Everyone can be a hero
We are, we are
Sometimes up then down to zero
We are, we are
Heroes, heroes
Look this old man's only teeth
When he smiles underneath
Searching for some food on the ground
The musician at the store
Selling his guitar for naught
It's rent that matters not the sound
They're all fighting through their lives
Against their enemies
Reaching out for the light
Everyone can be a hero
We are, we are
Sometimes up then down to zero
We are, we are
Heroes
Everyone can be a hero
We are, we are
Sometimes up then down to zero
We are, we are
Heroes
Everyone can be a hero
We are, we are
Sometimes up then down to zero
We are, we are
Heroes, heroes
2. Battle's Won
Ohhhhhh!
Yeah!
Come on!
Shoot down their legions they die in vain
helpless against your advanced weaponry
what they will get is their names on display
maybe a casket if there's funds left to pay these at all
Left in the swamps bent over rocks
that's the glorious take of their lives
what they just got is eternal fame
rats and dogs devouring their sorry remains
You made 'em suffer and pay their price
watched from far above them
however their history has just been changed
their past is gone once more
Stand tall
your battle's won
all foes defeated, done
and feasts achieved
with fate on your side
rejoice for evermore
victor to the core
you excelled by all means
went on and on
Yeah!
There's more dispatches for killing sprees
checking out grounds for the next genocide
greed for profit advances being paid
tech shares soar balanance sheet rising up high
Can you remember that hero we had
who bombed that lot to ashes?
Ask is whereabouts summon him now
employ that guy once more
Stand tall
your battle's won
all foes defeated, done
and feasts achieved
with fate on your side
rejoice for evermore
victor to the core
you excelled by all means
went on and on
Ohhhhhh!
Stand tall
your battle's won
all foes defeated, done
and feasts achieved
with fate on your side
rejoice for evermore
victor to the core
you excelled by all means
went on and ooooooh
Stand tall
your battle's won
battle's won
your battle's won
Ohhhhhh!
3. My God-Given Right
Why should I wait, what is left there for me?
I come to claim
To win the game
Why should I plea for my fair and right move?
I come to play
I come to stay
I don't wanna bitch around no more
I don't wanna stand back anymore
It's my god-given right
To stand and fight
For what I like
It's my god-given brain
That cried in pain
Would I resign
There's nothing to gain
If I would restrain
There's nothing to find
If I stay behind
It's my right
My god-given right
Why should I lose if I am meant to win?
I know I can
I've got a plan
All that they told me is right and so wrong
I went through schools
Found my own rules
I don't wanna bitch around no more
I don't wanna stand back anymore
It's my god-given right
To stand and fight
For what I like
It's my god-given brain
That cried in pain
Would I resign
There's nothing to gain
If I would restrain
There's nothing to find
If I stay behind
It's my right
My god-given right
It's my god-given right
My god-given right
It's my god-given right
It's my god-given right
To stand and fight
For what I like
It's my god-given brain
That cried in pain
Would I resign
There's nothing to gain
If I would restrain
There's nothing to find
If I stay behind
It's my right
My god-given right
4. Stay Crazy
Could we ever stop the thing we dare to live and love?
I doubt it
Could we ever picture to be back at home
And stay wholehearted?
We don't need to talk about it
We will never fear or doubt it
On and on
We sing our songs
Until we are gone
We wanna stay crazy
As fresh as a daisy
We wanna stay easy
And don't stop believing
Life's a show
Oh, a word and a blow
We wanna stay crazy
And never get lazy
We wanna live our way
Each day as a heyday
Life's a show
Oh, we wanna stay crazy
Are we ever looking back with sorrow and regret?
I doubt it
If there ever was a better way to live a dream
We found it
We don't need to talk about it
We will never fear or doubt it
On and on
We sing our songs
Until we are gone
We wanna stay crazy
As fresh as a daisy
We wanna stay easy
And don't stop believing
Life's a show
Oh, a word and a blow
We wanna stay crazy
And never get lazy
We wanna live our way
Each day as a heyday
Life's a show
Oh, we wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
As fresh as a daisy
We wanna stay easy
And don't stop believing
Life's a show
Oh, a word and a blow
We wanna stay crazy
And never get lazy
We wanna live our way
Each day as a heyday
Life's a show
Oh, we wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
5. Lost In America
We are stranded in Belize
Ten hours we must wait
They started with a flight show
So the airport opens late
Nobody really told us
Nobody seems to know
Now we're sitting here all drinking
We hope to catch the show
Finally they make the call
We toddle to the boarding
In the plane we're drunk and loud
When the captain gives a shout
We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
There's a cloud
There's a star
We should plunder the sky bar
We are lost
Lost in America
Now the captain says the gauges
Don't really seem to be
In the best trustworthy status
As far as he could see
Some ridiculous disturbance
Or a simple full breakdown
Makes it hopeless to impossible
To measure where we're bound for
Finally they make the call
We toddle to the boarding
In the plane we're drunk and loud
When the captain gives a shout
We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
There's a cloud
There's a star
We should plunder the sky bar
We are lost
Lost in America
We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
There's a cloud
There's a star
We should plunder the sky bar
We are lost
Lost in America
We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
6. Russian Roulé
Can anybody tell me how I gotta do it right?
I need a revelation
Can anybody tell me how to turn back to the light?
I'm yearning for salvation
I don't know
Which way to go
So I
Come out and play
I come out and play
Russian roulé
Come out and play
Russian roulé
Better to die trying than to rot away in vain
The last stop to damnation
Better to be fighting for a better life in pain
Than living on probation
I don't know
Which way to go
So I
Come out and play
I come out and play
Russian roulé
Come out and play
Russian roulé
Somebody tell me how to live my life
Must I break the rules?
Somebody tell me how I have to fight
To live to win, to live up high
Come out and play
Come out and play
Russian roulé
Come out and play
I come out and play
Russian roulé
Come out and play
Russian roulé
Russian roulé
Russian roulé
Russian roulé
7. The Swing Of A Fallen World
Achiever, believer
You saint and cold deceiver
It's the swing of a fallen world
Religion, tactician
Dark horse and politician
It's the swing of a fallen world
Betray, but you won't get away
The damage is done
A million to one
I bet we will witness the war of the sun
The game that we play
Is now here to stay
We never can stop what we've sent on its way, no
It's the swing of a fallen world
The swing of a fallen world
Impeacher, false preacher
Grand man and paltry creature
It's the swing of a fallen world
Manslaughter, garroter
You've slain, you rough-housed daughter
It's the swing of a fallen world
Bye bye, you too will die
The treasure we had
So crazy and mad
Was sold out by people who cannot be glad
A handful of greed
A contagious seed
A handful of assholes who never recede
This adverse evolution
Mankind knows no solution
It's the swing of a fallen world
The damage is done
A million to one
I bet we will witness the war of the sun
The game that we play
Is now here to stay
We never can stop what we've sent on its way, no
It's the swing of a fallen world
The swing of a fallen world
8. Like Everybody Else
Dreamer, why don't you think like everybody else?
People, don't you care 'bout what they say?
Deceivers, they break you down and make you pay
Brothers, they don't understand any word you say
All your life you are fighting
They're trying to force you in
When the time has come
You'll not be alone
Cause walls broke down
They'll see they were wrong
When the time has come
There'll be more of you
With all their strength
You'll show them the truth
Mistreaters, they don't care, but fear your will
Sisters, they don't understand any word you say
All your life you are fighting
They're trying to force you in
When the time has come
You'll not be alone
Cause walls broke down
They'll see they were wrong
When the time has come
You ain't no fool
Cause walls broke down
They stop being cruel
When the time has come
There'll be more of you
With all their strength
You'll show them the truth
Dreamer, why can't you be like everybody else?
9. Creatures In Heaven
Are you waiting on something profound in your life?
Something to touch your core?
Making up for what seems millions of years
Reaping the goods, but not sure...
Come along, come along
Can you see there's more?
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right
More than the toil to endure each day
Or the ache you forget and leave behind
If creatures roamed the space in heaven
They're angels, beasts, or supermen
Do they ease attaining things
No one believed you'd achieve?
So once you may ascend to heaven
Someone there has made it so
You could be the one they've been waiting for
Still running about seeking sense in your life
What you couldn't make count before
Taking much of your time is grieving about things
Well, you could care less, what's that for...
Come along, come along
Can you see there's more?
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right
More than the toil to endure each day
Or the ache you forget and leave behind
Come along, come along
Can you see there's more?
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right
More than the toil to endure each day
Or the ache you forget and leave behind
If creatures roamed the space in heaven
They're angels, beasts, or supermen
Do they ease attaining things
No one believed you'd achieve?
So once you may ascend to heaven
Someone there has made it so
You could be the one they've been waiting for
10. If God Loves Rock 'n' Roll
Ticking, ticking, ticking
Always counting right down
The clock strikes ten
You still wear your old gown
Come on, come on, come on
Get the hell up and stay
Alert and strong
Try to find your right way
People say it's wrong
People say it's bad
Others say that god's a little mad
Secretly he'd wear the black, you know
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better protect my soul
'cause heaven seems to be
The place I wanna be
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better reset my goal
Do everything I can
To be a rocking man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Leather suits you better
Got to let your hair grow
Take the black and enjoy the new show
Welcome to an army spreading over the world
Wild and proud brothers
Haven't you heard?
People say it's wrong
People say it's bad
Others say that god's a little mad
Secretly he'd wear the black, you know
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better protect my soul
'cause heaven seems to be
The place I wanna be
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better reset my goal
Do everything I can
To be a rocking man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If god loves rock 'n' roll
Even in heaven you need a bass guitar
A guitar and a second guitar
Here we go...
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better protect my soul
'cause heaven seems to be
The place I wanna be
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better reset my goal
Do everything I can
To be a rocking man
If god loves rock 'n' roll
If god loves rock 'n' roll
If god loves rock 'n' roll
11. Living On The Edge
He was a guy who had no education
He never learned to love and now he hates society
He never had somebody who would listen
He never had a friend that he could talk to when he's down
He has to suffer mental discomposure
He never learned to pay, he's only taking what he needs
His only friends are hate and violation
To get arrested some day is his only destination
Too late the damage's done is everything you hear
And when you're dead and gone nobody cries a tear
Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger, living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose
He's hating light
He loves to live in shadows
Where he can hide his fears
When he is crying secret tears
He's hating light
He loves to hide in darkness
Where he can hide his feelings and emotions
His enemies
Too late the damage's done is what they always say
You never get your chance you lose it anyway
Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger just like living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose
You never had the chance to prove
That you’re a man full of emotions
You only learned how to survive
In your environment of darkness
You build a fortress 'round your soul
Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger, just like living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose
12. Claws
I spread my wings and fly
I'm the ruler of the skies
Avoided my detection
So I've been here all my life
Floating up, diving down, hovering left and right
There's no escaping me
I'll make you out at night
Up from the sky I peek below
Seeking easy prey
To find the rodent that you are
Dive forward, in a flash
I'm taking aim and closing in
Your life and limb are at my mercy
I sink my claws
Into your flesh
Tear it up
Rip it all apart
You've got no choice, I will prevail
I fly around and laugh
Like the rascal that I am
See my own reflection in a lake
As I sweep across the land
I crave a goat but the dogs are out
Running left and right
There's no escaping these
I better make it home by night
Up from the sky I peek below
Seeking easy prey
To find the rodent that you are
Dive forward, in a flash
I'm taking aim and closing in
Your life and limb are at my mercy
I sink my claws
Into your flesh
Tear it up
Rip it all apart
You've got no choice, I will prevail
I sink my claws
Into your flesh
Tear it up
Rip it all apart
You've got no choice, I will prevail
I spread my wings and fly
13. You, Still Of War
Wake up
Alone I find myself on my knees
I see those footsteps on this crystal frozen sea
No bird, no tree nor any other living creature seen
Wind the only thing I can hear
Cloud transitions passing by above my head
While I'm moving I see my feet are deep blood red
Hey
I find myself alone
What happened suddenly?
Hey
I find myself alone
Is this my destiny?
I spread my wings and fly to find those of my kind
As I will not survive the loneliness
Don't wanna let you down no matter who you are
I can't believe I am the only one
Ah, you still of war
Ah, you still of nevermore
Ah, you still of war
Hush
Frozen cities, ashes fallen off the trees
I killed those who chose me for a nuclear decease
Hey
I'm made in fire
What happened suddenly?
Hey
Exploding is my desire
Is this my destiny?
I spread my wings and fly to find those of my kind
As I will not survive the loneliness
Don't wanna let you down no matter who you are
I can't believe I am the only one
No!
Hey
I'm made of steel
What happened suddenly?
Hey
I just eject from seals
Is this my destiny?
I spread my wings and fly to find those of my kind
As I will not survive the loneliness
Don't wanna let you down no matter who you are
I can't believe I am the only one
Ah, you still of war
Ah, you still of nevermore
Ah, you still of war
All these tears I've cried
Flowing into seas
All the memories gone
Of this human breed
All these years I've tried
To be just your threat
All the triggers made you
And me a hand of death
All the creatures died
New generations bloom
Frontier ahead, on an airplane
Led me into doom
No, you still of war
No, you still of war
No!
14. I Wish I Were There
How the wind picks up your hair
Behind you a palm and the ocean
How I wish I had been there
Yeah, too often we're not together
Yeah, too often I'm far away
Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there
I'm listening to all of your stories
What you've done and what you've seen
Your face so small on my iphone
And I'm touching you on screen
Yeah, too often we're not together
Yeah, too often I'm far away
Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there
I never had a doubt I would achieve it
I never allowed myself to fail
But then when I was there
I wished I were where you were
I wish I had been there
I think I got the moral of the story
For every wish granted there's a snag
The genie in the bottle never tells to take care
I wish I had been there
Wish I had been there
Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there
Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there
I wish I had been there
I wish I had been there
I wish I had been there
Wish I had been there
15. Wicked Game
I'm the master of a shady revolution
I don't care about your constitution
You can call it quite a lunatic rebellion
Yeah right, I am a hellion
I will return with glory
I know how to win this game
I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what you're gonna say
Wicked game
Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds
I'm not sorry for a bad decision
All I care about is my own vision
Super sonic boom with all my power
I'm back for your last hour
I will return with glory
I know how to win this game
I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what you're gonna say
Wicked game
Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds
I came into the world to play
I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what you´re gonna say
Wicked game
Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds
Wicked game
I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what you're gonna say
Wicked game
Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds
Wicked game
Wicked game
Wicked game
16. Free World
Living my life as good as it gets
No more dictators, no thought control
No asshole calls you a fool
The world's growing colder
Can I prevent?
Can I see clearer?
Can I understand?
Imagine living in a free world
Nations to be one
Living in a free world
I know it can be done
Living in a free world
Glorious and wild
Living in a free world
Hand in hand we start a better day
No politicians telling you lies
Breeding their profits
We pay the price
Endless oppression comes to an end
Hope and relief all over the land
Over the rainbow I see a light
Time for deliverance
I'm ready to strike
Imagine living in a free world
Nations to be one
Living in a free world
I know it can be done
Living in a free world
Glorious and wild
Living in a free world
Hand in hand we start a better day
Imagine living in a free world
Nations to be one
Living in a free world
I know it can be done
Living in a free world
Glorious and wild
Living in a free world
Hand in hand we start a better day
17. Nightmare
now I got you under control
you can't deny me
I am living deep in your soul
now you are my victim
and I do as I please
now you are wailing
but you'll never find your peace
nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
you fall asleep and I come closer
there's no escape
I'm living in your mind
nightmare in the darkness
eternal lifetime
just what you were asking for
I gave you all but you are still asking for more
now I am your anger
I'm your darkest desire
you wanted all but now you're burning in hellfire
nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
I'll get you when you close your eyes
you can't resist
I'm living in your soul
nightmare in the dark
you fall asleep and I come closer
I'll get you when you close your eyes
now your addiction's getting stronger
and now there is no turning back
nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
you fall asleep and I come closer
there's no escape
I'm living in your mind
nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
I'll get you when you close your eyes
you can't resist
I'm living deep in your soul
I am your nightmare in the darkness
I am your nightmare in the dark
I am your nightmare in the darkness
18. More Than A Lifetime
Overruled, we are racing through time
Hiding our souls and emotions away
Fearing that we all can be left behind
Scared about sharing our hopes in a world full of lies
Cold as a stone we are playing our part
Pushing it to the extreme
Still there's a fire that burns in your heart
Save it and never let go
More than a lifetime it takes
In a world that is made out of madness
More than a lifetime it takes
To find out we know nothing at all
Faster and faster we're pushing our limits too high
All what we see is the profit
Paid with the blood of the weak and the poor
Stone cold and careless we're playing our part
Avarice is all that we know
Still there's a fire that burns in your heart
Save it and never let go
More than a lifetime it takes
In a world that is made out of madness
More than a lifetime it takes
To find out we know nothing at all
Out of the blue there will rise a new day
Don't let them tear you apart
Chances are few but you'll find your own way
And you try another start
More than a lifetime it takes
In a world that is made out of madness
More than a lifetime it takes
Carry on with the struggle
On with that struggle
On with the show called life

1. First Time
Will you first time... Will it be... I think of someone like me ?
Makes me wonder,I can show you'd neverthought you'd see.
You're like sunshine,I can feel your heat is drying out my brain,
Would you feel like... like we're having fun it Ican do the rain ?
Have you thought out your dreams, do you have some ?
Let's see if we can find some more.
Give me your fancies at random,I think we can deal with them all.
I can't wait forever, baby, open me your door,
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more.
I can see you standing there, you know you're worth the try,
Let me guide you in my spaceship and I'll surely make you have
A  R e a l  G o o d  T i m e .
Don't waste time now - you are soaking wet, so fix the things you got,
Guess you know how - and when you're done I dotta see you strut.
My desire - can I watch you rock and know which one of choose ?
I'm no liar - I could take you down and you got nothing to lose.
I don't know any better occasion, can't hold back, it's the end of the day
I don't think you're here for the first time, no problem with me anyway.
I can't wait forever, baby, open me you door,
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more.
I can see you standing there, you know we have a try,
I can feel this night is special and I surely make you have
A  R e a l  G o o d  T i m e.
I can't wait forever, baby, open me you door,
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more.
I can see you standing there, you know we have a try,
I can feel this night is special and I surely make you have
A  R e a l  G o o d  T i m e ......
2. When The Sinner
Now it's time - to shake it all up, to be free,
Now it's time - to make us some room to let us be.
Oh, it feels so bad, yes, if fells so bad,
When everything good looks so bad,
When everything right goes so wrong.
I am up - to break it all down what's in my way,
I won't stop until I am where I'm going to stay.
No one holds me back, no, no one holds me back,
Don't wanna be what I am not,
But it's gotta be myself who breaks my neck.
I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
= Over my head - look over my head =
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
= And you won't see no halo =
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
= It's driving me mad =
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know,
= I must hold it back inside =
But anyway we've got to make a stop.
When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !
In my mind - the battle goes on 'til I give up,
Will we find - the key of life we oncehave dropped ?
Do you realy care ? - Tell me you realy care !
You may find Mr. Blane, but the guilt of life burns everywhere.
Give me light to see my inside, give me light tosee my sin,
= Over my head - look over my head =
I'd never do what I regret, I've never done anything bad,
= And you won't see no halo =
You must be joking when you point at me.
Hey ! Don't you blame me ! Don't you touch me !
Won't you ever leave me be ? I wanna live! Don't wanna think!
= It's driving me mad =
Why should I give what I can drink ?
= I must hold it back inside =
When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !
Pain - I feel inside - it's such a Shame.
No one fights fair but who's to Blame ?
Might be the game of life but it ain't over.
Now ! I walk my way firm any
Now ! My conscience speaks andthere are Doubts !
But nothing's sure in life and it ain't over. Now !
I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
= Over my head - look over my head =
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
= And you won't see no halo =
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
= It's driving me mad =
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know,
= I must hold it back inside =
But anyway we've got to make a stop.
When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you ! ......
3. I Don't Wanna Cry No More
Hey, brother, I miss you so - you knoked on heaven's door,
And we won't see you anymore - it must be crazy what we're living for.
'Cause God's stopped keeping you on the ladder of you life,
I call your name with tears in my eyes.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
Life's like a walking on a high wire,
You slipped away, I've seen you dying in vein.
High as mountains seem all the problems that I have,
But when I hear your voice far away out of the dark -
You just go on and on in the back of my mind.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
Skin and bone won't touch the sky,
I hope you'll find passage out of the dark.
To the otherside of the sea and I know that I'll see you again.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
4. Crazy Cat
My little crazy cat took a train to meet his gang downtown.
They played Black Jack< Fritz played his false game too far.
A guy got up and started a gunfight.
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.
Addicted to chicks, he's got a rental tree near the nudist beach.
Oh, watch out ! Booze and ladies are his fate.
Too much sex and food and Rock'n'Roll.
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.
5. Giants
Strong and invincible, they know every rule,
Seems inconceivable anything they do.
They made us their slaves - we weren't unified,
Ever since we paid for selling our lives.
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
Deprived of our consciousness, we can't predict what's more,
Can you remember how things used to be before ?
I secretly dream of things we will be taught,
Will someone esteem for those who have fought ?
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
Strong and invincible, they know every rule,
Seems inconceivable anything they do.
Deep in our hearts we hope our dreams come true,
The only thing is "What are we to do ?"
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
Won't you say it ... Can't you feel it .. ?
6. Windmill
Time goes whenever you are, time is your guiding star,
That shines all through your life, makes you feel and move.
My dreams are out in the far, so are yours a part
Of secret fairy tales, dripped on the wings of a mystery mill.
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning -
Show me the way, take me today.
Windmill, windmill, hearts are yearning -
Longing for love and a chance to be free.
Don't feel alone and depressed, someone will come at last,
To soothe your stumbling mind, to keep it away from the evil storm.
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning -
Show me the way, take me today.
Windmill, windmill, hearts are yearning -
Longing for love and a chance to be free.
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning ...
Time goes whenever you are ...
7. Revolution Now
Well,I think it's really time again for a revolution,
Not to destroy at all costs but have a look at what's there.
Can you remember a time when water was still water,
Or are you too young to even know what we won't give to our heirs ?
Inhale the bless of science through your lungs, skin and brain !
It'll surely make our children feel a lot more sanel.
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...
I was born when April guaranteed a sexual renaissance,
And today we're all faced with death, rubbers and AIDS.
In'68 some people went out to fight for freedom,
They would never ever have thought that their children wear ties.
And if you come to San Francisco -
You're gonna meet some broken people there.
Revolution now ! Revolution now ! Revolution now ! Now !
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...
8. In The Night
In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.
I always try to makethings better, everything that has gone wrong,
Mighty plans in the right direction but very little has been done.
Everyday when I try to get forward - I find myself another mile back,
Help me fighting, help me breathing - why am I falling down instead ?
Every useful minute seems to be the thoughtof you,
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do.
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but it's true.
In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.
Free from ourselves and free form this world we may find,
The freedom we search ,'cause all that we need is inside.
The hours we waste - we may not get back for a while,
And when it gets dark - no chance will be there for atry.
When I wake up early in the morning I catch abook and jump inside,
I fill my head with a million wonders and try to fill the night with light.
The moment when I get things clearer - I see another mountain to climb.
And always when I think I'm nearer - I realize there is no time.
In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
Sometimes I cried after all Ilied to you.
9. Music
When I was a young boy I had no aim,
Neither experience - it wasn't a shame.
Most of the time it satisfied me,
But some day I realized - music is like a rising sun.
Times are now changing and memory fades,
I gaze at the photos, a look in the haze.
You cannot imagine how many friends I've lost,
It's much too late for calling them back.
Music is like sunrise for me,
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine.
Music is like sunrise for me - it's like coming home.
I was always insecure, sometimes I still am,
But I made up my mind now - and look here I stand.
I ask myself sometimes: "Is it all worth it ?"
To fly over mountains - makes you fall down again
But music is like sunrise for me,
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine.
Music is like sunrise for me - it's like coming home.
Music is like sunrise for me,
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine.
Music is like sunrise for me - it's like coming home.
10. Step Out Of Hell
Time has come, start your search for tomorrow,
No escape from that long trail of sorrow.
You don't know how it keeps going on. Oh ... No ...
Wake up out of misty dreams,
Evil drugs is starting to grab you, to grab you.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help ... But can I ?
You did your best to keep yourself down,
Give it a rest and just turn around !
It's only a one way street of lies ... Yes it is !
Living in a twilight zone,
Get away out of that drug jungle, that drug jungle.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help you.
Another line, have a good time, you don't mind
To turn you brain inside out, to serve the final rite.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help you !
11. I Believe
Give me two strong arms to fight my enemies,
Give me two eyes to see the truth.
Give me two legs I think I have to run,
And fill my heart with faith that I won't lose.
I don't wanna lose ...
Give me one real love that I don't freeze out there,
Make me feel your presence in the night.
Give me one strong heart that tells me when I lie,
And take my soul - so I won't have to hide.
I don't wanna hide ...
It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall,
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do I believe.
I Believe ... I Believe ...
It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall,
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do ...
There'll be no reason to live without you giving me light,
There is so much that you give, your love is shining so bright.
I Believe ... I Believe ... I Believe ... Believe ...
I wanna love but I always hate - I wanna give but I always take.
Want you to laugh but I make you cry, maybe I won't change 'til I die.
It's so much easier said than done - I know I can't just always run.
Got so much anger inside of me, I understand but I think I see what I'm not.
I know it's true what J.C. said - I got it all clear in my head.
Seens we were born to be unfair,
I am a sinner that's starting to dare ... to Believe.
Give me your hand until the end and I will waik into promised land.
I don't deserve anything you do - but I can't stop loving you.
No more lies, no false religions,
No more "whys" and wrong God missions.
No shiny T.V. priests begging to cash,
No more wars that no God's ever asked for.
There's a way back out of here - one day we're going home,
Tell everyone who wants to hear - whatever you do ... do Believe.
I Believe ... We Believe ... Believe ... Oh !
12. Longing
Feelings come and go - I've never known,
Something longs to grow - won't let go.
Spirits around my head - are whispering,
I turn inside instead - of wondering.
Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be,
A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit free.
If I don't wanna know - what's written inside me,
How could I see anything - how could I be anything ?
Restless minds have searched - long before,
The truth will be same - for evermore.
The mightiness of trees - that you can feel,
Can give you all you need - just listen still.
Here is love and there is pain.
It's all around, it's all the same,
There's nothing new that I cuold tell to you.
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts,
We might not know the mining yet, but I am sure we can't reject
The truth that is in everything - that is and has been and will be.
There is a long way to go - there is a high place to know,
There is a world to go through - but there's so much more to do
Until we're home !
Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be,
A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit free.
If I don't wanna know - what's written inside me,
How could I see anything - how could I be anything ?
Feelings come and go - I've never known...

2. Cut In The Middle
Ice cold Metalmonster creeping
Through the darkest night
Heart of gold and steel
Because I don't know what to write
Pins and chains and bullet-bells round my metal chest
All that shit looks good on me even if I'm getting fat
Squeeze my ass into leather pants
It needs to be so tight
Tons of beer and alcohol
It brings me through the night
Cut in the middle
Couldn't hurt me too bad if I weren't here
Can someone tell me what it's all supposed to mean
The answer isn't really clear
In a world of lines and pills that where I wanna be
Look at me I am dangerous I lost reality
I look into the mirror babe, I tell you what I see
Is my awful crabface really dirty smiling at me
And sometimes I feel so down and depressed and
What I do is to remember all the past
And my best friend will be the IOU
Cut in the middle
Couldn't hurt me too bad if I weren't here
Can someone tell me what it's all supposed to mean
The answer isn't really clear

4. Get Me Out Of Here
I can't tell you how it happened
So I guess we'll never know
I'm always late and running out of time
So I must be very slow
Someone must have smoked too much
Or is it only dust
My pals just tend to leave here in disgust
My flat is a mess same as ever before
My suits they stink like you don't wanna know
Junk to the left, trash to the right
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore
When the postman rings I stay in bed
I never make it down
My fridge must be alive inside
It's uttering funny sounds
If I don't know what time it is
I peek out if there's sun
No use anyway, my money's gone
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore

1. Judas
You promise us a bright golden future
You say you will save the world
That there will be no more hunger and pain
But we only see your golden hands
You say you take care of our survival
Sending us missiles instead
But you just betray us, deny us and lie
And you always say you would
Fight for freedom, fight for rights
I see treason in your eyes.
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
Your worship money and economy
There's nothing that you wouldn't do
If the payment is right you don't care about life
'Cause economy is your truth
You are the one selling terror and pain
In all the parts of the world
You are preparing the final grand slam
But you keep on tellin' you'll
Fight for freedom, fight for rights
I see treason in your eyes.
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
Judas, Judas - are you still human?
Judas, Judas - I can't believe it
Judas, Judas - dealing with evil
Judas, Judas
You'll keep on telling you'll
Fight for freedom, fight for rights
I see treason in your eyes.
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
2. Ride The Sky (Live)
Much too long I've been a prisoner here
The hour has come to break out
Shackled and chained almost goin' insane
It's better to live on the run
Set me free, set me free
Send me a sign, wanna leave it all behind
I'll be leaving the hands of doom
Rearrange the master plan, take the future in my hands
To be free and not trapped anymore
Ride the sky, Ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, Ride the sky
I have to think for myself and then act
In conformity of my own thoughts
No one should tell me what's wrong and what's right
Why don't you leave me alone
Set me free, set me free
3. Guardians (Live)
We're living in our units
And one thing we can do is
Work for a life without a fate
We don't pay any taxes
But the state is the axes
Of our minds without love without hate
We have a higher order
No one needs to be a hoarder
Our society is such a glorious thing
In our centers we can dream of
Anything you never think of
You can't say we are puppets on a string
Our minds are kept so clean
Checked up on a screen
They're holy men, they're saints
Without them we might all fail
We don't know war and crime
Things of ancient times
We just see it if we put on video
The blue pass is for my life
And the red one's for my wife
It's the only thing we really need to show
There are still some without rules
But I tell you, they're all fools
The Guardians will find them as we've seen
We got banks where we freeze them
They get new brains screwed in then
And act contrarily to what they have been
With new minds made so clean
Checked up on a screen
They will be the saints
Without them we might all fail
Guardians of our lives
Protect security
They turn the key and they step in
Controlling you and me
Guardians of our lives
Take care eternally
Puppets on a string
Puppets on a string
4. Victim Of Fate (Live)
I was born in the rotten part of the town
The biggest trap I had seen
Wherever you'll go and wherever you'll get to
Evil is around
My mother's a bitch my father's a killer
Gettin' paid for a murder
Fightin' and strugglin' the whole day
The only way to survive
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
Fly high touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
I had to kill people to save my own life
I don't wanna go to hell
I started at the bottom
I'm heading for the top
I'll never return I'll never go back
To the Goddamn part of the town
Headhunters won't get me 'cause I'm not stupid
But this ain't the life I dreamt of
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
What now lonly man who's standig
In the shadow of the streets
You're left alone with no helpin' hand beside you
You hide from the daylight livin in darkness
You got no friends you can trust nobody
Except for yourself
The only shade that's beside you
Is the shade of Lucifer
Laughing with a satanic smile
And his friend death sharpens his sickle
You don't wanna die do you ? But you will
You will burn in hell
Fly high, touch the sky, you will die !
5. Cry For Freedom (Live)
"Freedom" this cry of all slaves will be heard
And the tyrants will feel the steal of the sword
The chains will be broken by all slaves on the earth
Forever to be free from their load
Time has run out for all you tyrants on earth
Your slaves are heedin' the call
Makin' an end to all this terror and pain
An end to your lies and your law
Takin' away all your gold and your money
'cause dead men don't need it anymore
Much too long we felt the slash of your whips
So now you will feel or swords
Freedom the eternal cry will echo high in the sky
The day will come when all power has been broken
Your blood will flow down to the gates of hell
Satan will wait for your souls
Pray to your god he won't help you he's dead
He won't fool our minds and our soul... anymore
Freedom the cry of all slaves will be heard
The tyrants will now feel the steel of the sword
The chains will be broken by all slaves on earth
Forever to be free from their load
... Forever to be free from their load

1. Skyfall (Single Edit)
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Watching the stars falling down from the sky in the night
Crashing from out of the heavens they're burning so bright
Descend through the atmosphere, glowing with fiery light
Dragging a tail of white sparkles, and oh, what a sight
Oh, where did I go, how could I know?
Defies all reason now
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
There's no turning back
To find my way home
Hey little alien, little grey
Where's the place your people stay?
Have you found a place beyond
Where eternity moves on?
Let me detach you, help me find
What goes on in your captor's mind
For eternity awaits
On the brink of our escape
We're twisting, we're turning
We're running, we're burning
Out on the run through the maze
On through the madness
No time for sadness
And no one can show us the way
Through Hangar 18
The tension now grows
We're getting so close
Enter the ship, start the engine and open the gates
Of Hangar 18
Onwards to the sky, the stars are bright, they'll shine forever
On and on we fly, so far away
Hey little alien
What have they done to you?
Are there survivors here
Or have they all just disappeared
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
Was no turning back
To find my way home
The dark, the fear of the night
And the pain settles down deep within
Coming home to a place still unknown
And the hope as I dream is undying
When the sky falls,
And the world you know comes crashing down
When the sky falls,
And everything is changing
Changes came across the sky,
Welcome to the other side
And everything is changing
When the sky falls
When the sky falls
2. Skyfall (Exclusive Alternative Vocals Mix)
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Watching the stars falling down from the sky in the night
Crashing from out of the heavens they're burning so bright
Descend through the atmosphere, glowing with fiery light
Dragging a tail of white sparkles, and oh, what a sight
Oh, where did I go, how could I know?
Defies all reason now
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
There's no turning back
To find my way home
A signal sent out of distress,
I was heeding the call
Then they appeared and attacked me,
My ship took the fall
Now I am strapped to this table,
They're poking my eyes
I only hope I would come out of this,
Still alive
Oh, where did I go, how could I know?
Give me a reason now
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
There's no turning back
To find my way home
Hey little alien, little grey
Where's the place your people stay?
Have you found a place beyond
Where eternity moves on?
Let me detach you, help me find
What goes on in your captor's mind
For eternity awaits
On the brink of our escape
We're twisting, we're turning
We're running, we're burning
Out on the run through the maze
On through the madness
No time for sadness
And no one can show us the way
Through Hangar 18
The tension now grows
We're getting so close
Enter the ship, start the engine and open the gates
Of Hangar 18
Onwards to the sky, the stars are bright,
They'll shine forever
On and on we fly, so far away
Hey little alien
What have they done to you?
Is this your planet home?
I see what's wrong with you
It's all destroyed and burned,
To ashes all reduced
Are there survivors here,
Or have they all just disappeared?
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
Was no turning back
To find my way home
The dark, the fear of the night
And the pain settles down deep within
Coming home to a place still unknown
And the hope as I dream is undying
When the sky falls, and the world
You know comes crashing down
When the sky falls,
And everything is changing
Changes came across the sky,
Welcome to the other side
And everything is changing
When the sky falls,
When the sky falls
We're just two aliens,
Lost without a home
We travel on, we see the light
Another star, another fight
Onwards through the universe,
To find a home, to break the curse
Stars on the horizon
Stars on the horizon
Come and take us home
We're coming home,
We're coming home
Someday we're gonna find a home
Somewhere out in space
Somewhere out in space...

1. Pink Bubbles Go Ape
Some people are much too smart
They know everything before it starts
Eating wisdom with the pail
No wonder when it sticks
In your darkest hour I will sing this song for you
Cry and tell
And slander
Yell and grumble well
So loud for heaven's sake
Pink bubbles go ape!
2. Kids Of The Century
We poison our hearts
We poison our seas
We burn down the paradise
We're stoppin' good waves
We're losin' our trees
The future looks bright ahead
I don't wonder we'll go under in this river of lies
We're lost in this time--we create so fine
The future we already fear
Seems like no way out, seems like there's no doubt
The future looks bright ahead
We're the kids of the century--we're lost in our games
No time for the memories we look in the haze
We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault
Ev'rything's done mum, we fall
Let's keep on crying
But sometimes I don't wanna fall
Ev'rytime when you look around things will smile at you
Ev'rytime when you turn around you smell the truth
But you run away from the lies you can't say
Don't run away from the lies you can't say
We're the kids. . .
3. Back On The Streets
I've been told in the name of something
I've got to know what it means to play the game
Too many faces around they're talking
They play their parts oh, so well but who's to blame
Back on the streets, that's where we are
Building a fortress of power, yeah!  We're coming
You know better than me the rules are:
Getting better or fat in the mania
It's good to know who is who in our game
The speed is faster, it's harder to see where we are
Back on the streets. . .
Please Mister Know-how just bring me the news
I'm waiting so long for you telling me all you can tell
There's one thing about you, you're dying to prove
The master plan is yours and living with knowledge is hell
Back on the streets. . .
4. Number One
Each time when one more year was over
You refused to hear heavven's bells sound
And the happiness in you heart's been set lower
You were searching for friends but no one seemed to be 'round
You merely should think of the good times
'Cos there are so many ways you can go
Take a look at yourself, you're still very young
And big aims always take very long
Now it's time for happiness, stay hard and trust your fate
Don't forget you're something else you'll never be too late
Trust your fathers' mighty spell you'll never be alone
Fate will always turn out well and you'll be number one
Shout at the world don't care what they say
'Cos your life is now, here and today
Luck is there, ev'rywhere
Go on, reap its goods, that's the way
You wanna have truth, relief from your pain
But life takes its toll again and again
Don't fear the night--your future is paid
And the tracks to your aims are laid
Now it's time. . .
5. Heavy Metal Hamsters
There are some fellows soft and mellow
Sitting in the field and play like hell
No one knows the way it goes
But all the songs they play they sound so well
Tonight we go to see the Heavy Metal Hamsters
It must feel nice to be a Heavy Metal Hamster
Nothing sets you free like our Heavy Metal Hamsters
A 20th century Fox came by
A gold tipped cigarette high in his jaws
contracts, PDs, Nose-Bags, TV-shows
And everything with no remorse
Things are settled now for our Heavy Metal Hamsters
Fame up to your brows, oh Heavy Metal Hamster
A previously unknown lifestyle Heavy Metal Hamster
The sweet taste of success is strong
And everything inside goes wrong you see
With coloured furs, sunglasses
Tons of nuts to eat, they don't feel free
What is wrong with our Heavy Metal Hamster?
Look what they have done our Heavy Metal Hamsters
Where is the field to run for our Heavy Metal Hamsters
Some things are left undone for our Heavy Metal Hamsters
6. Goin' Home
You think I could be the one to look inside your mind
I don't think we'll have the time, so let us get in line
Another town another bed, another thing to go
By now I learned to take it cool, but I don't wanna know
My head is empty, all the stories that I've known I've told
The situation I escaped from, now it looks like gold
Anyway and anyhow we did it, it was good
But now I take the time to think 'bout ev'rything I should
'Cause after this I'm gone, the show is done
No other town or bed that lies ahead
I'll go home to what I know
I'll go home, home to you
By the time that you think 'bout it twice no spotlight makes you stay
By the time that you feel you don't know, you have to go
The plane is ready in my head, so many things to do
A few more hours till it's over I reach out for you
A kind of peace inside is growing, thinking 'bout the shows
Until the next time I'll be so much better, yes I know
Now this is it I'm gone, the show is done
No other town or bed that lies ahead
I'll go home to what I know
I'll go home, home to you
I'll go home. . .
7. Someone's Crying
What keeps on telling me to stay on the way I chose
What keeps on giving me all the strength to carry on
Give me some time, can't sleep anymore at night
I wanna show I'm here with an aim of mine
I feel strong, but someone is crying, I know
It's so hard to find a sign of a way to go
Don't need to stone my brain, I need my head for something else
I wanna live and learn, step by step I'm going on
Send me a sign, don't wanna resign too soon
What situation will come I can't endure
I feel strong, but someone is crying, I know
It's so hard to find a sign of a way to go
Send me a sign, don't wanna resign too soon
What situation will come I can't endure
8. Mankind
Here is all mankind so proud of their achievements
There is a stone that is warmer than you
Look how we stand in the stream of illusions
No one says a word
Here you laugh and there you cry
All that makes you move
There's no fear for anything
Anything but you
Animals dying for our vanity
Our world is a beautiful place to be free
Drinking the blood of the weak, it's so easy
No one hears them cry
Here you cheat and there you lie
All that makes you gain
One day we will face His throne
There's nothin' we can say
Prosperity, luxury, fast food is rising
It's the rainforest that dies
Here you laugh and there you cry
All that makes you move
Here you cheat and there you lie
All that makes you gain
9. I'm Doin' Fine CRAZY Man
Thunder, flash and lightening is working on my back
The tables in the kitchen are tryin' to break my neck
All the late night memories are leaning in my shoes
My mother's old grey leather gloves are singing loud the blues
I can taste what's in the sun
No time to waste 'cause there is none
When I feel blue I see it shine
But still it's true I'm doin' fine
You can't see me 'cause now I'm all free
Now you know I'm through
And all that's not new
Sitting on a paperback 'cause I don't know what really cracks
I'm tryin' to climb my pencil to get high
No one tells me what to do 'cause no one knows what I've been through
You don't know a thing but you can learn
It's time to touch the sky
My mind is free I fly
I can taste. . .
10. The Chance
We're living in a constant fight
Too much pressure everywhere
And all around
Don't let it pull you down
Hold on tight
Cling to your dreams
Don't you depend on someone else
Think for yourself and win the race
The chance you got comes never twice
Do your best, (and) do it right
Time will come but don't you hide
You are on your way
You're led by God but you're not a pawn
Should live your life, don't care 'bout any scorn
Just let them fool around
No need to cry
Don't give up
Try to be as smart as you can be
I know you own so much ability
11. Your Turn
Now there is this day, a lot of things are changing
Can't just kick it away, got to get things right
Sometimes it happens fast and nothin' seems to last
The thing that I once started isn't mine anymore
I guess now it's my turn
You've got a face like a child, got a mind like a woman
Your smile is warm and tender
I hear the people say that I should stay away
From you and all the problems you might bring
They'll never know--you
Nobody ever knows what to do
They'll never see you cry
They'll never know why
Now it's your turn to break free
When you want it all you've got to see
Now it's your turn to break free
When you want the life, you've got to see what it means
See the little boy holding mama's hand
His eyes can see the things we've long forgotten
The world is easy now--and somehow
He's right
Until there is this day when Mickey Mouse must go away
It's your turn to break free. . .
This world is crying to be free
This world is dying can't you see
We need a turn to do it right
We need a mind-revolution
To get away from this selfishness
Stop playing blind--break free
1. Initation
2. I'm Alive
You, you say, you have lost the way
Got no aim, just livin' for today
Look up to the sky above
And see the morning sun again
You got so much power inside
So cry it out my friend
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive
There's no use in hangin' all around
You're a king, can't you see your crown
Look into my eyes
So many things are waiting to be done
you just need a friend
Together we will sing along
Look into my eyes
So many things are waiting to be done
You just need a friend
Together we will sing along
3. A Little Time
Higher
It's what I expect from my life
It's like a wire
That holds me back down to the ground
Oh, I hear you say
"That is the way of the world"
No, hear what I say
"I wanna do so much in my way"
Higher
I've set my limits and bounds
There's a fire
It's burning so hot in my head
Oh, I hear you say
"That is the way of the world"
No, hear what I say
"I wanna do so much in my way"
We got
A little time to build up our lives
A little time to make up our minds
A little time to fill up our dreams
A little time, time
4. Twilight Of The Gods
We'we thrown away our former gods
Controlling our day
We have created better ones
So we control the way
We are the ones with the power
To hold down the enemy
Our gods are perfection
And they are protecting our lives
We still need some more of them
To be safe from the other side
As long as we're stronger
Nothing will happen to us
Fireflash in the night
Just an evil dream
Holy war in the sky... never
Error in store 103
We watch the sun at night
The pretty gods we're built ourselves
Now terminate our lives
Silicone brain powered voices
Are crying "attack" tonight
Our gods are now fighting
In anger, burning our world
Doomsday has come
And there is no place to hide away
The future is over
And there is no turning back
Fireflash in the night
Now reality
Holy war in the sky.....
Twilight of the gods
Insania's dead and gone
Another world was born
But the twilight soon will come
Fireflash in the night
Now reality
Holy war in the sky.....
5. A Tale That Wasn't Right
Here I stand all alone
Have my mind turned to stone
Have my heart filled up with ice
To avoid it's breakin' twice
Thank to you, my dear old friend
But you can't help, this is the end
Of a tale that wasn't right
I won't have no sleep tonight
In my heart, in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong, young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain
It's alright, we'll stay friends
Trustin' in my confidence
And let's say it's just alright
You won't sleep alone tonight
With my heart, with my soul
Some guys cry you bought and sold
They've been strong, young and bold
And they say, play this song again
6. Future World
If you're out there all alone
And you don't know where to go to
Come and take a trip with me to Future World
And if you're running through your life
And you don't know what the sense is
Come and look how it could be, in Future World
We all live in happiness our life is full of joy
We say the world "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness is always at our side
We love our life and we know we will stay
'Cause we all live in Future World
A world that's full of love
Our future life will be glorious
Come with me - Future World
You say you'd like to stay,
But this is not your time
Go back, find your own way to Future World
Life can be for living
Just try and never give in
Tell everyone the way of Future World
One day you'll live in happiness
With a heart that's full of joy
You'll say the world "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togerherness will be at your side
You'll say you love your life and you'll know why
7. Halloween
Masquerade, masquerade,
Grab your mask and don't be late
Get out well disguised
Heat and fever in the air tonight
Meet the others at the store,
Knock on other people's door
Trick or treat they have no choice,
Little ghost's are makin' lotsa noise
But watch out... beware - listen... take care
In the streets on Halloween
There's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween
The spirits will arise
Make your choice, it's hell or paradise
Ah - It's Halloween
Ah - It's Halloween... tonight!
Someone's sitting in a field,
Never giving yield
Sittin' there with gleamin' eyes,
Waiting for big pumpkin to arise
Bad luck if you get a stone,
Like the good old Charlie Brown
You think Linus could be right
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie
But watch out... beware - listen... take care
Listen now - we are calling you...
And there is magic in the air
Magic in the air... on Halloween
Black is the night full of fright
You'll be missing the day
What will be here very soon
Changing your way
A knock at your door
It is real or is it a dream
On trembling legs you open the door
And you scream... on Halloween
Darkness
Where am I now
Is there anybody out there
What has happened
Am I in heaven
Or is it hell
I can see a light comin'
It's comin' nearer
It's shining
It's shining so bright
It's shining on me
I am the one, doom's in my hands
Now make your choice,
Redeemed or enslaved
I'll show you passion and glory
He is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance
He's the corrupter of man
Save me from the evil one
Give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind's
Deliverance and peace of mind
But watch out... beware - listen... take care
Yeah, it's Halloween
Yeah, it's Halloween... tonight!
8. Follow The Sign
Now that you've made your choice
Follow the sign
Did you make your choice?
You're the Keeper of the seven key
Our only hope's your victory
So follow the sign
1. Judas
You promise us a bright golden future
You say you will save the world
That there will be no more hunger and pain
But we only see your golden hands
You say you take care of our survival
Sending us missiles instead
But you just betray us, deny us and lie
And you always say you would
Fight for freedom, fight for rights
I see treason in your eyes.
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
Your worship money and economy
There's nothing that you wouldn't do
If the payment is right you don't care about life
'Cause economy is your truth
You are the one selling terror and pain
In all the parts of the world
You are preparing the final grand slam
But you keep on tellin' you'll
Fight for freedom, fight for rights
I see treason in your eyes.
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
Judas, Judas - are you still human?
Judas, Judas - I can't believe it
Judas, Judas - dealing with evil
Judas, Judas
You'll keep on telling you'll
Fight for freedom, fight for rights
I see treason in your eyes.
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
2. Ride The Sky (Live)
Much too long I've been a prisoner here
The hour has come to break out
Shackled and chained almost goin' insane
It's better to live on the run
Set me free, set me free
Send me a sign, wanna leave it all behind
I'll be leaving the hands of doom
Rearrange the master plan, take the future in my hands
To be free and not trapped anymore
Ride the sky, Ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, Ride the sky
I have to think for myself and then act
In conformity of my own thoughts
No one should tell me what's wrong and what's right
Why don't you leave me alone
Set me free, set me free
3. Guardians (Live)
We're living in our units
And one thing we can do is
Work for a life without a fate
We don't pay any taxes
But the state is the axes
Of our minds without love without hate
We have a higher order
No one needs to be a hoarder
Our society is such a glorious thing
In our centers we can dream of
Anything you never think of
You can't say we are puppets on a string
Our minds are kept so clean
Checked up on a screen
They're holy men, they're saints
Without them we might all fail
We don't know war and crime
Things of ancient times
We just see it if we put on video
The blue pass is for my life
And the red one's for my wife
It's the only thing we really need to show
There are still some without rules
But I tell you, they're all fools
The Guardians will find them as we've seen
We got banks where we freeze them
They get new brains screwed in then
And act contrarily to what they have been
With new minds made so clean
Checked up on a screen
They will be the saints
Without them we might all fail
Guardians of our lives
Protect security
They turn the key and they step in
Controlling you and me
Guardians of our lives
Take care eternally
Puppets on a string
Puppets on a string
4. Victim Of Fate (Live)
I was born in the rotten part of the town
The biggest trap I had seen
Wherever you'll go and wherever you'll get to
Evil is around
My mother's a bitch my father's a killer
Gettin' paid for a murder
Fightin' and strugglin' the whole day
The only way to survive
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
Fly high touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
I had to kill people to save my own life
I don't wanna go to hell
I started at the bottom
I'm heading for the top
I'll never return I'll never go back
To the Goddamn part of the town
Headhunters won't get me 'cause I'm not stupid
But this ain't the life I dreamt of
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
What now lonly man who's standig
In the shadow of the streets
You're left alone with no helpin' hand beside you
You hide from the daylight livin in darkness
You got no friends you can trust nobody
Except for yourself
The only shade that's beside you
Is the shade of Lucifer
Laughing with a satanic smile
And his friend death sharpens his sickle
You don't wanna die do you ? But you will
You will burn in hell
Fly high, touch the sky, you will die !
5. Cry For Freedom (Live)
"Freedom" this cry of all slaves will be heard
And the tyrants will feel the steal of the sword
The chains will be broken by all slaves on the earth
Forever to be free from their load
Time has run out for all you tyrants on earth
Your slaves are heedin' the call
Makin' an end to all this terror and pain
An end to your lies and your law
Takin' away all your gold and your money
'cause dead men don't need it anymore
Much too long we felt the slash of your whips
So now you will feel or swords
Freedom the eternal cry will echo high in the sky
The day will come when all power has been broken
Your blood will flow down to the gates of hell
Satan will wait for your souls
Pray to your god he won't help you he's dead
He won't fool our minds and our soul... anymore
Freedom the cry of all slaves will be heard
The tyrants will now feel the steel of the sword
The chains will be broken by all slaves on earth
Forever to be free from their load
... Forever to be free from their load

1. Pumpkins United
Take heed, beware
There's something in the air
Grown to an almighty size
It's loud and it gleams
And with fury it screams
See the big Pumpkin arise
From out of sight it's been
But growing deep within
To boiling point excited
The fire is ignited
Here we are, here we go
Shout it out, let them know
Like a bright shining star
Pumpkins United we are
We're red hot
Beware, beware
Something's in the air
The Halloween monsters arise
The pieces brought back
From the book of the dead
By Dr. Stein brought back to life
Oh, my God, we burn
The point of no return
To pleasure point excited
The fire is ignited
Here we are, here we go
Shout it out, let them know
We're a light in the dark
Pumpkins United we are
And we're riding the sky like the eagle
We wake up the mountain a far
We're blasting the walls in Jericho
Pumpkins United we are
Pumpkins United
Red hot
Sing it high, sing it low
Shout it out, let them know
We're a light in the dark
United we are
And we're riding the sky like the eagle
We wake up the mountain a far
We're blasting the walls in Jericho
Pumpkins United we are
United we are
Red hot
Red hot
United
United
