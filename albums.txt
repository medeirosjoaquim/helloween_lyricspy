1. Starlight
You're hanging around and got nuthin' to do
You wanna get out some pills in front of you
You fly on invisivble wings
Be careful my friend for too many can kill
You say that the meaning of life's in those pills
You forget all earthly things
You swallow your pill you wanna feel free
A trip to a world made of games
You do it again yet it's never the same
But a junkie's not somethin' to be
Starlight! Shinin' down for your soul to arise!
Now there's a needle lying in front of you
I'm frightened of those things
But I'll know what you'll do
You need it to escape from the night, ha ha
You ride on thru heaven you don't feel no pain
You ride on and ride on again and again
On the needle that brings you the light
You feel the mind-blowin' stuff
Flow thru your veins
You take off and fly to the sun
But when you get too near your wings will be burnt
You'll die in the flames and you'll fall
2. Murderer
He said get out of here nobody wants you here
You smashed his head and the man died
And there's a murmur loud
From the appearing crowd
Searching for motives and reasons why
Now take a look at yourself and you'll see
What you are in the eyes of the world
You didn't want it but now he's dead
And you're on the run from the law
You're a murderer - in every town
murderer - to the whole world
murderer - you're on the run
murderer - you'll have to kill...again!
And like an animal which escaped from the cage
They're hunting you over their holy land
Traps waiting everywhere you fall in deep despair
Darkness and night your only friends
One day the chase will be over for you
And you'll find your own peace in the end
Some day you will find sanctuary
Death!...but so long my friend!
Look for a safe place where noone will find you
And try to escape from the law
Wherever you are there's a killer behind you
Wanting to get you for sure
To lose the fear that one day he will get you
Be faster and kill him and run
Now you don't have to fear him no more
But in his place another headhunter will come
...run away!
3. Warrior
Blackened sky a final flash
Death is in the air
Warriors without a face
Destruction everywhere
Silent falls the hammer
Noone hears the cries
No escaping from this hell
Your prayers won't be heard...so die
Brainless cruel commanders
Sending death and pain
Soldiers only robots
Fight for their life in vain
Die now die warrior!
Die now die warrior!
Somewhere in the shelter sit the men
Who hold your fate in hands
Playin' chess and you're the loser
You're a small pawn in their game
Somewhere in the shelter sit the men
And they don't realise
A war without survivors is a fight
That's never won...so die!
Barren land desolate waste
Destruction is complete
Survivors creeping thru the ruins
Decaying flesh and meat
Somewhere in a shelter
Some pigs are still alive
And still they play the game
They don't give a damn...so die!
4. Victim Of Fate
The biggest trap I had seen
Wherever you'll go and wherever you'll get to
Evil's all around
My mother's a bitch, my father's a killer
Gettin' paid for a murder
Fightin' and strugglin' the whole day
The only way to survive
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
I had to kill people to save my own life
I don't wanna go to hell
I started at the bottom
I'm heading for the top
I'll never return I'll never go back
To the goddamn part of the town
Headhunters won't get me 'cause I'm not stupid
But this ain't the life I dreamt of
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
What now, lonely man who's standing
In the shadow of the streets?
You're left alone with no helpin' hand beside you
You hide from the daylight living in darkness
You got no friends, you can trust nobody
Except for yourself
The only shade that's beside you
Is the shade of Lucifer
Laughing with a satanic smile
And his friend death sharpens his sickle
You don't wanna die, do you?
But you will
You will
You will burn in hell
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
You will die!
5. Cry For Freedom
"Freedom" this cry of all slaves will be heard
And the tyrants will feel the steel of the sword
The chains will be broken by all slaves on the earth
Forever to be free from their load
Time has run our for all you tyrants on earth
Your slaves are heedin' the call
Makin' an end to all this terror and pain
An end to your lies and your law
Takin' away all your gold and your money
Cause dead men won't need it anymore
Much too long we felt the slash of your whips
So now you will feel our swords
Freedom the eternal cry will echo high in the sky
The day will come when all power has been broken
Your blood will flow down to the gates of hell
Satan will wait for your souls
Pray to your god he won't help you he's dead
He won't fool our minds and our souls...anymore!
Freedom the cry of all slaves will be heard
The tyrants will now feel the steel of the sword
The chains will be broken by all slaves on earth
Forever to be free from their load
...forever to be free from their load!
1. Walls Of Jericho
2. Ride The Sky
Much too long I've been a prisoner here
The hour has come to break out
Shackled and chained almost goin' insane
It's better to live on the run
Set me free, set me free
Send me a sign, wanna leave it all behind
I'll be leaving the hands of doom
Rearrange the master plan, take the future in my hands
To be free and not trapped anymore
Ride the sky, Ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, Ride the sky
I have to think for myself and then act
In conformity of my own thoughts
No one should tell me what's wrong and what's right
Why don't you leave me alone
Set me free, set me free
3. Reptile
Coming from the sewerage creepin' thru the pipes
Born from modern chemistry a thing that is alive
Growing in this rotten crap at places no one wipes
Eating rats and stinking shit and all it needs to thrive
The scientists got no way to fight
For they can't find any weak point to get rid of it right
You live your life and you don't know what's goin' on
You just can't stop a thinking that the officials do you wrong
You're sometimes wondering what the hell bit your baby's arm
And the nuns at the holy mission can't keep the tramps from harm
Even thieves around dark corners too scared to leave the door
Frustrated businessmen needing a wank can't find themselves a whore
You won't believe 'till you know that it's real
From the pain in your stomach and the horror you feel
You need a shit so you head off to the loo
You're coming to the bog, now what you're gonna do !
There's the Reptile (Reptile)
Just see his eyes
Reptile (Reptile)
Can you see the beast arise
Reptile (Reptile)
Creeping up on you
Reptile (Reptile)
There's nothing left that you can do
And there's the Reptile (Reptile)
Hidden till now
Reptile (Reptile)
But now it's there you don't know how
Reptile (Reptile)
Just watch it grow
Reptile (Reptile)
And there's no more human being left but you
Oerrrps !
4. Guardians
We're living in our units
And one thing we can do is
Work for a life without a fate
We don't pay any taxes
But the state is the axes
Of our minds without love without hate
We have a higher order
No one needs to be a hoarder
Our society is such a glorious thing
In our centers we can dream of
Anything you never think of
You can't say we are puppets on a string
Our minds are kept so clean
Checked up on a screen
They're holy men, they're saints
Without them we might all fail
We don't know war and crime
Things of ancient times
We just see it if we put on video
The blue pass is for my life
And the red one's for my wife
It's the only thing we really need to show
There are still some without rules
But I tell you, they're all fools
The Guardians will find them as we've seen
We got banks where we freeze them
They get new brains screwed in then
And act contrarily to what they have been
With new minds made so clean
Checked up on a screen
They will be the saints
Without them we might all fail
Guardians of our lives
Protect security
They turn the key and they step in
Controlling you and me
Guardians of our lives
Take care eternally
Puppets on a string
Puppets on a string
5. Phantoms Of Death
There are phantoms here on earth who take away our lives
They kill your kids and they rape your wives
They rip your flesh tear your heart take you down to hell
They don't give a damn on any kind of life
Phantoms bring evil, destruction and death
Night after night the same old game
They all look so harmless but deep in their hearts
Satan is lurking, and he will break out
Always someone at your back only waiting to attack
Phantoms of death, Phantoms of death
The empire of deceivers is built upon your fear
You'll have to lose it 'cause the end is near
Warheads, armies stand to strike I know it isn't right
I wanna get out of here I don't wanna die
Infernal destruction of fire you'll burn
Then you'll be helpless but it's not too late
Stand up right now and you'll be the winner
Or Satan will get you, take you forever
Genocide everywhere, where's the saviour of this world
Phantoms of death, Phantoms of death
Where is he the promised saviour the one who'll save the earth
Perhaps he'll come to bury us but then it'll be too late
Who are they who are the phantoms who will end our lives
It's you and me, you and me open up your eyes
Phantoms bring evil, destruction and death
Night after night the same old game
They all look so harmless but deep in their hearts
Satan is lurking, and he will break out
We are all parasites of this world we shall die
Phantoms of death, Phantoms of death
6. Metal Invaders
Fool moon standing in the streets
I know the time is near
Incarnate power roaring from the sky
Unrelenting forces blasting through the air
Roaring thunder lift your hands and pray
Running through the empty streets they're looking for the fight
Swords gleam in the light of moon the gods prepare to strike
Metal invaders, ready to strike
A warning from hell, be careful tonight
Dark night overwhelming bright light
See the demons fly
Can't trust your senses fear you'll have to die
Super mighty shadows casting amplitudes to ears
Sounds you've never heard that take you high
Time has come for them to rise, invasion is their doom
Riding high on iron horses in the light of moon
Metal invaders, the gods on their ride
Sworn to bring metal, mayhem tonight
7. Gorgar
You're runnin' around in the gamblin' hall
Every night it's the same
You're lookin' for something new to play
To win and have fun is your aim
A pinball speaks to you
His metal voice is knockin' in your head
You can't resist you'll have to play
You're just another victim caught in the trap
Gorgar will eat you, Gorgar - man you'll never win - hey
Gorgar will eat you, Gorgar - but you keep on playin' - hey
Your blood is boilin' your eyes grow wide -
Advance - too late
Gamblin' fever has taken your mind - this fuckin' machine of hate
You spend all your money but you'll never win
You're always the loser and the robot's voice keeps hammering
Gorgar will eat you, Gorgar - man you'll never win - hey
Gorgar will eat you, Gorgar - but you keep on playin' - hey
Wastin' money for fun every night
Livin' for today no thoughts for tomorrow
Man you are dead don't you realize
Wake up and live before it's too late
Gorgar will eat you, Gorgar - man you'll never win - hey
Gorgar will eat you, Gorgar - but you keep on playin' - hey
TILT
8. Heavy Metal (Is The Law)
Fight hard
Live fast
Play loud
Step out of the crowd
Iron
Rulin'
Steel bent
Forever the faith will live on in our hearts
There's nothing else in all the world
That will bring it down
We will play our wildest step to all around
We need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood
Power
Burnin'
Brains out
United metallians ready to strike
White heat
Red hot
Mayhem
If you don't feel it you won't understand
There's nothing else in all the world
That will bring it down
We will play our wildest step to all around
We need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood
Heavy Metal is the law that keeps us all united free
A law that shatters earth and hell
Heavy Metal can't be beaten by any dynasty
We're all wizards fightin' with our spell
9. How Many Tears
A lot of things occur each day
We've got to live with on our way
There's so much misery on the screen
With commercials in between
And the Russians won't be so late
Uncle Sam don't wanna wait
No matter if you're black or white
You never ever had a right
And look up to the eternal skies
See warfare even there
What once has been a paradise
Now destruction and despair
In other worlds the children die
Lacking food ill from a fly
Oppressed by troops to tame their land
It's all the same again
If any man is free on earth
Then tormentors steal his birth
They slam gun butts in his face
And leave his woman choked in mace
So stand up for our human rights
Push back this pest of hate
Raise you voice pass on the light
Unite! it's not too late
How many tears flow away
To become a sea of fears
How many hearts are torn apart
Till another torment starts
But before the world
Turns into a sun
All cruelty and violence
On earth will be dead and gone
So stand up for our human rights
Push back this pest of hate
Raise you voice pass on the light
Unite! it's not too late
1. Judas
You promise us a bright golden future
You say you will save the world
That there will be no more hunger and pain
But we only see your golden hands
You say you take care of our survival
Sending us missiles instead
But you just betray us, deny us and lie
And you always say you would
Fight for freedom, fight for rights
I see treason in your eyes.
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
Your worship money and economy
There's nothing that you wouldn't do
If the payment is right you don't care about life
'Cause economy is your truth
You are the one selling terror and pain
In all the parts of the world
You are preparing the final grand slam
But you keep on tellin' you'll
Fight for freedom, fight for rights
I see treason in your eyes.
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
Judas, Judas - are you still human?
Judas, Judas - I can't believe it
Judas, Judas - dealing with evil
Judas, Judas
You'll keep on telling you'll
Fight for freedom, fight for rights
I see treason in your eyes.
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
Judas - sittin' in the government
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified

4. Victim Of Fate (Live)
I was born in the rotten part of the town
The biggest trap I had seen
Wherever you'll go and wherever you'll get to
Evil is around
My mother's a bitch my father's a killer
Gettin' paid for a murder
Fightin' and strugglin' the whole day
The only way to survive
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
Fly high touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
I had to kill people to save my own life
I don't wanna go to hell
I started at the bottom
I'm heading for the top
I'll never return I'll never go back
To the Goddamn part of the town
Headhunters won't get me 'cause I'm not stupid
But this ain't the life I dreamt of
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
What now lonly man who's standig
In the shadow of the streets
You're left alone with no helpin' hand beside you
You hide from the daylight livin in darkness
You got no friends you can trust nobody
Except for yourself
The only shade that's beside you
Is the shade of Lucifer
Laughing with a satanic smile
And his friend death sharpens his sickle
You don't wanna die do you ? But you will
You will burn in hell
Fly high, touch the sky, you will die !
5. Cry For Freedom (Live)
"Freedom" this cry of all slaves will be heard
And the tyrants will feel the steal of the sword
The chains will be broken by all slaves on the earth
Forever to be free from their load
Time has run out for all you tyrants on earth
Your slaves are heedin' the call
Makin' an end to all this terror and pain
An end to your lies and your law
Takin' away all your gold and your money
'cause dead men don't need it anymore
Much too long we felt the slash of your whips
So now you will feel or swords
Freedom the eternal cry will echo high in the sky
The day will come when all power has been broken
Your blood will flow down to the gates of hell
Satan will wait for your souls
Pray to your god he won't help you he's dead
He won't fool our minds and our soul... anymore
Freedom the cry of all slaves will be heard
The tyrants will now feel the steel of the sword
The chains will be broken by all slaves on earth
Forever to be free from their load
... Forever to be free from their load

2. I'm Alive
You, you say, you have lost the way
Got no aim, just livin' for today
Look up to the sky above
And see the morning sun again
You got so much power inside
So cry it out my friend
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive
There's no use in hangin' all around
You're a king, can't you see your crown
Look into my eyes
So many things are waiting to be done
you just need a friend
Together we will sing along
Look into my eyes
So many things are waiting to be done
You just need a friend
Together we will sing along
3. A Little Time
Higher
It's what I expect from my life
It's like a wire
That holds me back down to the ground
Oh, I hear you say
"That is the way of the world"
No, hear what I say
"I wanna do so much in my way"
Higher
I've set my limits and bounds
There's a fire
It's burning so hot in my head
Oh, I hear you say
"That is the way of the world"
No, hear what I say
"I wanna do so much in my way"
We got
A little time to build up our lives
A little time to make up our minds
A little time to fill up our dreams
A little time, time
4. Twilight Of The Gods
We'we thrown away our former gods
Controlling our day
We have created better ones
So we control the way
We are the ones with the power
To hold down the enemy
Our gods are perfection
And they are protecting our lives
We still need some more of them
To be safe from the other side
As long as we're stronger
Nothing will happen to us
Fireflash in the night
Just an evil dream
Holy war in the sky... never
Error in store 103
We watch the sun at night
The pretty gods we're built ourselves
Now terminate our lives
Silicone brain powered voices
Are crying "attack" tonight
Our gods are now fighting
In anger, burning our world
Doomsday has come
And there is no place to hide away
The future is over
And there is no turning back
Fireflash in the night
Now reality
Holy war in the sky.....
Twilight of the gods
Insania's dead and gone
Another world was born
But the twilight soon will come
Fireflash in the night
Now reality
Holy war in the sky.....
5. A Tale That Wasn't Right
Here I stand all alone
Have my mind turned to stone
Have my heart filled up with ice
To avoid it's breakin' twice
Thank to you, my dear old friend
But you can't help, this is the end
Of a tale that wasn't right
I won't have no sleep tonight
In my heart, in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong, young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain
It's alright, we'll stay friends
Trustin' in my confidence
And let's say it's just alright
You won't sleep alone tonight
With my heart, with my soul
Some guys cry you bought and sold
They've been strong, young and bold
And they say, play this song again
6. Future World
If you're out there all alone
And you don't know where to go to
Come and take a trip with me to Future World
And if you're running through your life
And you don't know what the sense is
Come and look how it could be, in Future World
We all live in happiness our life is full of joy
We say the world "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness is always at our side
We love our life and we know we will stay
'Cause we all live in Future World
A world that's full of love
Our future life will be glorious
Come with me - Future World
You say you'd like to stay,
But this is not your time
Go back, find your own way to Future World
Life can be for living
Just try and never give in
Tell everyone the way of Future World
One day you'll live in happiness
With a heart that's full of joy
You'll say the world "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togerherness will be at your side
You'll say you love your life and you'll know why
7. Halloween
Masquerade, masquerade,
Grab your mask and don't be late
Get out well disguised
Heat and fever in the air tonight
Meet the others at the store,
Knock on other people's door
Trick or treat they have no choice,
Little ghost's are makin' lotsa noise
But watch out... beware - listen... take care
In the streets on Halloween
There's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween
The spirits will arise
Make your choice, it's hell or paradise
Ah - It's Halloween
Ah - It's Halloween... tonight!
Someone's sitting in a field,
Never giving yield
Sittin' there with gleamin' eyes,
Waiting for big pumpkin to arise
Bad luck if you get a stone,
Like the good old Charlie Brown
You think Linus could be right
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie
But watch out... beware - listen... take care
Listen now - we are calling you...
And there is magic in the air
Magic in the air... on Halloween
Black is the night full of fright
You'll be missing the day
What will be here very soon
Changing your way
A knock at your door
It is real or is it a dream
On trembling legs you open the door
And you scream... on Halloween
Darkness
Where am I now
Is there anybody out there
What has happened
Am I in heaven
Or is it hell
I can see a light comin'
It's comin' nearer
It's shining
It's shining so bright
It's shining on me
I am the one, doom's in my hands
Now make your choice,
Redeemed or enslaved
I'll show you passion and glory
He is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance
He's the corrupter of man
Save me from the evil one
Give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind's
Deliverance and peace of mind
But watch out... beware - listen... take care
Yeah, it's Halloween
Yeah, it's Halloween... tonight!
8. Follow The Sign
Now that you've made your choice
Follow the sign
Did you make your choice?
You're the Keeper of the seven key
Our only hope's your victory
So follow the sign
1. Dr. Stein
Once they killed his monster when it went into a trap
Now he's making better ones on a higher step
On a warm summer day the doctor went away
To a place where he could make it real
His assistant's hips were nice
So he cloned her once or twice
Now his hips are aching what a deal
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great rock musicians
And their time is right
Sometimes when he's feeling bored
He's calling it a day
He's got his computers and they do it their own way
They mix some DNA, some skina and a certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and grey
Or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Halloween
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great politicians
And their time is right
One night he cloned himself
Put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind and thought "well never mind"
Took a syringe and blew out his life
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become a great possession
And their time is right
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become a great oppression
And their time is right
2. Savage
You hear the people talking you walk the wrong street
Painting all things black and step on your feet
Flabby stomach, styled hair, trousers full of air
Their morality is real ours isn't there
They don't know, no they can't see
Our hearts close to the sun
Different in our hearts filled with
That faith we carry on
They just call us savage
That's what I like to be
Let them call us savage
Cause that's what we like to be
See the people wonder we run in our direction
Let the narrow-minded sleep we better do some action
Across the universe you smell the smell of lies
I'm trying to be the winner not the sacrifice
See them run they know no fun
And look what they have done
In this world full of rules
We look just like fools
I know what they think when I see them lookin' at me
(Savage)
We come close every day to the time table life
So mart they start their backwards fight
I know what they think when I see them lookin' at me
(Savage)
One day they will drop the bomb
Cause it's necessary to show the power
One day they will give a shit on what you say
3. Livin' Ain't No Crime
Come hither to this place and let your mind fly free
For that's the only way how everyone should be
We all need something that we can keep on livin' for
No one needs to tell us what we're doin' anymore
Head on, head on steady - until the end of time
Living, living ready - for livin' ain't no crime
So tell me, aren't we all just one holding the flame
Against al the babbits in this world who build up frames
Some time or tomorrow we will prove them traitors wrong
So make your dreams come true for it mustn't take too long
Head on, head on steady - until the end of time
Living, living ready - for livin' ain't no crime
Now what's the use of living here and what's it worth
Don't ask but throw away your fear this earth
You are here to live don't think you're here to understand
Don't forget you're no one without someone's helping hand
Head on, head on steady - until the end of time
Living, living ready - for livin' ain't no crime
4. Victim Of Fate
The biggest trap I had seen
Wherever you'll go and wherever you'll get to
Evil's all around
My mother's a bitch, my father's a killer
Gettin' paid for a murder
Fightin' and strugglin' the whole day
The only way to survive
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
I had to kill people to save my own life
I don't wanna go to hell
I started at the bottom
I'm heading for the top
I'll never return I'll never go back
To the goddamn part of the town
Headhunters won't get me 'cause I'm not stupid
But this ain't the life I dreamt of
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
What now, lonely man who's standing
In the shadow of the streets?
You're left alone with no helpin' hand beside you
You hide from the daylight living in darkness
You got no friends, you can trust nobody
Except for yourself
The only shade that's beside you
Is the shade of Lucifer
Laughing with a satanic smile
And his friend death sharpens his sickle
You don't wanna die, do you?
But you will
You will
You will burn in hell
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate
Fly high
Touch the sky
You will die!

1. I Want Out
From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No one asks us how we like to be
In school they teach you what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see
So they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this
I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free
People tell me A and B
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hear
But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
'Cause I decide the way things gonna be
I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free
There's a million ways to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool
In the end of it, none of us is right
Sometimes we need to be alone
No no no, leave me alone
I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free
2. Save Us
Too late to call for the priest
He is not here anymore
We look at the age of the beast
And we've seen its vast armies form
Hear our call
Please, save us
Please, save us
In permanent madness we live
No time for life and for love
To take is the rule, not to give
Insanity comes from below
To take us all
Please, save us
Please, save us
We believe that the phenomena of nature
Are the expression of infinitive intelligence
We express our belief that all forms of life
Are manifestations of spirit
And thus, all men are children of God
Far from down below one comes prepared to take us all
Waiting for his future and the final call
We stand on the edge of the world
Just one step more and we fall
Guide us and please take our hands
Without you we're weak and alone
Hear our call
Please, save us
Please, save us
Now!
Save us--from the gods of thunder
Save us--from the dogs of war
Save us--from the creeping nightmares
Save us--from the evil's course
Save us--from our own ignorance
Save us--from the man in black
Save us--from the desolation
Save us--from the hate attack
Save us--oh please
Save us--please save us
Save us--oh please
Save us--now!
3. Don't Run For Cover
You hide, won't fight
Avoid the daylight
Give in, won't win
No try to make it right
Why don't you stop crying
Stop your painful dying
Why don't you give your life a sense
One game, one aim
But you're always sleeping
One light so bright
In darkness you're creeping
Why don't you use your head
Step out of your warm bed
And stop being on anxious rat
Run - for your destination
Fly - to the sun
Don't give a damn what the people may say
It's like a chain on your leg
When you always look back
If you don't risk anything one day you'll pay
Don't run for cover
Don't cry alone
Make a step on your stairway
One step closer to what you live for
Don't run for cover
Don't throw away
The only chance that you got
To be the fire in a hot life you choose
No pride, no right ?
In your heart is more strength
You know, I know
Your destiny's in your hand
Now you have this time
To survive don't be blind
In this world where so many can't see
Try - to catch the key
Make - that you can see
The light of your life your way to go
So many hearts in these times
Are so cold they can't find
Their own power to win they don't know

1. Invitation (Intro)
2. Eagle Fly Free
People are in big confusion
they don't like their constitutions
everyday they draw conclusions
and they're still prepared for war
Some can say what's ineffective
some make up themselves attractive
build up things they call protective
well your life seems quite bizarre
In the sky a mighty eagle
doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
on its wings the rainbow's light
it's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free
let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind
follow the sign
together we'll fly someday
Hey, we think so supersonic
and we make our bombs atomic
or the better quite neutronic
but the poor don't see a dime
Nowadays the air's polluted
ancient people persecuted
that's what mankind contributed
to create a better time
In the sky a mighty eagle
doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
on its wings the rainbow's light
it's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free
let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind
follow the sign
together we'll fly someday
3. You Always Walk Alone
When I hold the key to open heaven's door
I will never make the mistake and give it back
when I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late
I will never give it back
There's just one way I see
the way I think it's right for me
you say to me I will repent what I do
if it's right I'll stop before
When I see the light of sun will fade away
And I reveal what I have loved before
it's too late when I can't see the hours I pay
and I reveal what I have loved before
There's just one way I see
the way I think it's right for me
you say to me I will repent what I do
if it's right I'll stop before
The life I try to give is
all I have inside of me
it's one kind of life for me
this music you hear
the strength we have inside is
so much more than you will know
but if you can't see the life around
you'll always walk alone
Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes
see his strong hands
but tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
see the drunk man, try to ask him why
he will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie
there's a fight in his head he cannot win
getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin
You--you cannot hide
You--you cannot describe your feelings inside
The life I try to give is
all I have inside of me
it's one kind of life for me
this music you hear
the strength we have inside is
so much more than you will know
but if you can't see the life around
you'll always walk alone
4. Rise And Fall
Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit
everyone could see him fall
and be sure it's been his last hit
he's never been seen at all
Some dictator felt progressive
and lay down in the sun
but his people were aggressive
they killed him with a gun
Sometimes you're wrong
by some things you have done
you see fate is too strong
nothing's won
no use for a fight
if you're not acting right
you'll be cut down to size
like a lie
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
so better use your brain
A little dragon could spit fire
but never so for something bad
he didn't know the knight's desire
to throw a lance into his head
Romeo loved his Juliet
their parents told them "Stop"
then it all turned out peculiar
he couldn't get it up
And it's all in vain
when you're living with pain
reap not goods you have grown
by your own
feelings you like
disappear overnight
you sip up every grin
free to win
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
you nearly go insane
A spaceman flies the rocket
that takes him to the stars
thinks his wife is in his pocket
but she's strolling 'round in bars
The king of Los Angeles
bought himself a teddy bear
and the queen became shameless
she did it with a chair
Sometimes you're wrong
by some things you have done
you see fate is too strong
nothing's won
no use for a fight
if you're not acting right
you'll be cut down to size
like a lie
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
so better use your brain
5. Dr. Stein
Once they killed his monster when it went into a trap
now he's making better ones on a higher step
On a warm summer day the doctor went away
to a place where he could make it real
his assistant's hips were nice
so he cloned her once or twice
now his hips are aching what a deal
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
lets them run into the night
they become
Sometimes when he's feeling bored
he's calling it a day
he's got his computers and they do it their own way
They mix some DNA, some skina and a certain spray
you can watch it on a laser screen
and the fellow's blue and grey
or sometimes pink and green
just check it out on Halloween
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures. . .
One night he cloned himself
put his brother on a shelf
but when he fell asleep that night
it crept up from behind and thought "well never mind"
took a syringe and blew out his life
6. We Got The Right
Don't turn your head
back to the wall
don't close your eyes
and wait for your fall
If you believe that you know in this time
you've got anything to win
if you believe that you know
then I say, "you'll lose all again"
In this time there's nothing to get for you
you cannot really do what you want
you're a child, a prisoner in your mind
you are a victim of this hopeless time
You better believe all you do has a sense
it's not for nothing
you better believe all the troubles you have
will play you someday
Why don't you help yourself and do the best
put all the bombs back up their builders' ass
why don't you stand up to say who you are
to show the people that paradise is not far
Oh, can't you see we got the right
to look into the future without no need to hide
no, we won't accept what you do
we stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse
oh, can't you see we got the right
to say we are here to see the light
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
We are credulous idiots
and won't understand what they plan
we march with the times
it's what they expect and we do
Why don't you open your eyes
to undercover all of these lies
I think you won't accept this
go oppose with your fist
fight for your rights
Oh, can't you see we got the right
to say we are here to see the light
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
7. Save Us
Too late to call for the priest
he is not here anymore
we look at the age of the beast
and we've seen its vast armies form
hear our call
Please, save us
please, save us
In permanent madness we live
no time for life and for love
to take is the rule, not to give
insanity comes from below
to take us all
Please, save us
please, save us
We believe that the phenomena of nature
are the expression of infinitive intelligence
we express our belief that all forms of life
are manifestations of spirit
and thus, all men are children of God
Far from down below one comes prepared to take us all
waiting for his future and the final call
We stand on the edge of the world
just one step more and we fall
guide us and please take our hands
without you we're weak and alone
hear our call
Please, save us
please, save us
Now!
Save us--from the gods of thunder
Save us--from the dogs of war
Save us--from the creeping nightmares
Save us--from the evil's course
Save us--from our own ignorance
Save us--from the man in black
Save us--from the desolation
Save us--from the hate attack
Save us--oh please
Save us--please save us
Save us--oh please
Save us--now!
8. March Of Time
Hours of lust, hours of tears passing by before my eyes
today, tomorrow, yesterday. . .one life
days of joy, day of sadness come and go to pass me by
a month, a year, one hundred years, they fly
Ohh, one day I will be gone to lead another life
ohh, and this world will stop to turn around with me
'cause
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally
Times of peace, times of fights, constant movement is our life
can't stop no more, not until. . .we die
we long for more. . .eternity, and maybe there's another life
this one is short, no matter how you try
Ohh, but never give up all the hope to lead a good life
no, don't waste your given time to make things worse
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
one without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally
Please, please help me see, the best way to be
make a change and we, live eternally
no more wasted years, no more wasted tears
life's too short to cry, long enough to try
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally

10. Keeper Of The Seven Keys
Make the people
hold each other's hands
and fill their hearts with truth
you made up your mind
so do as divined
Put on your armour
ragged after fights
hold up your sword
you're leaving the light
make yourself ready
for the lords of the dark
they'll watch your way
so be cautious, quiet and hark
You hear them whispering
in the crowns of the trees
you're whirling 'round
but your eyes don't agree
will 'o' the wisps
misguiding your path
you can't throw a curse
without takin' their wrath
Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
or all us people forget what we've been
our only hope's your victory
kill that Satan who won't let us be--kill!
You're the keeper of the seven keys
that lock up the seven seas
and the seer of visions said before he went blind
hide them from demons and rescue mankind
or the world we're all in will soon be sold
to the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
You can feel cold sweat
running down your neck
and the dwarfs of falseness
throw mud at your back
Guided by spells
from the old seer's hand
you're suffering pain
only steel can stand
Stay well on your way and follow the sign
fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
the seven seas are far away
placed in the valley of dust heat and sway
You're the keeper of the seven keys
that lock up the seven seas
and the seer of visions said before he went blind
hide them from demons and rescue mankind
or the world we're all in will soon be sold
to the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
Throw the first key into the sea of hate
throw the second key into the sea of fear
throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
and make the people hold each other's hands
the fourth key belongs into the sea of greed
and the fifth into the sea of ignorance
Disease, disease, disease my friend
for this whole world's in devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease my friend
throw the key or you may die
On a mound at the shore of the last sea
he is sitting, fixing your sight
with his high iron voice causing sickness
he is playing you out with delight
man who do you just think you are?
a silly bum with seven stars
don't throw the key or you will see
dimensions cruel as they can be
don't let him suck off your power
throw the key. . .!
An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming, and earth swallowing him away!
You're the keeper of the seven keys
you locked up the seven seas
and the seer of visions can now rest in peace
there ain't no more demons and no more disease
and, mankind, live up, you're free again
yes the tyrant is dead, he is gone, overthrown
you have given our souls back to light

1. Kids Of The Century
We poison our hearts
We poison our seas
We burn down the paradise
We're stoppin' good waves
We're losin' our trees
The future looks bright ahead
I don't wonder we'll go under in this river of lies
We're lost in this time--we create so fine
The future we already fear
Seems like no way out, seems like there's no doubt
The future looks bright ahead
We're the kids of the century--we're lost in our games
No time for the memories we look in the haze
We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault
Ev'rything's done mum, we fall
Let's keep on crying
But sometimes I don't wanna fall
Ev'rytime when you look around things will smile at you
Ev'rytime when you turn around you smell the truth
But you run away from the lies you can't say
Don't run away from the lies you can't say
We're the kids. . .
2. Blue Suede Shoes
Well it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go cat go
But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
For you can knock me down, step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But oh oh honey lay off of my shoes
Well you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
You can burn my house, you can steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
You can do anything that you wanna do
But oh oh honey lay off of my blue suede shoes
You can do anythind but don't step on my blue suede shoes
Well it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go cat go
But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue, blue suede shoes ...
3. Exclusive Helloween Interview
Well, Japan. We've been there, I think, two times now, and it's always been
a great fun playing there. I like the venues. They are sounding very good,
they look very good, and kids over there really appreciate good music and stuff.
And I think the next time we're gonna play at the Budokan, which is pretty cool.
Lookin' forward to it. It's gonna be fun.
Japan has been always great to play there, and will be in the future. And
Japan people are great, it's fun to play there and you feel very confident
and convinient or whatever to play there. And Japanese people are listening
very carefully, I don't know. It's great to be in Japan.
"Kids of the Century" is the first life sign of us after two and a half
years.  And after all those rumours going around about this band - me
leaving the band, me splitting up, or the band splitting up, and all that
stuff, which has been quite a lot. Maybe that's normal when the band's not
on the scene for a while.  But after that it feels really good to have,
actually, a new album ready and a single out. So the kids know we are still
there. And with the music you can prove what you can do still even without
one guy that just left the band. I think we found the right person there,
Roland. And I think the album says everything. Yeah, I wrote "Kids of the
Century" about more than two years ago now. And remembering that time I
feel like, when I wrote that song, I was in that feel of that all the kids
today, they just feel like they haven't got anything to do with the
problems.  Everything goes wrong, the nature or whatever. Just came out of
that feeling actually. And that's what the song's all about, I think. What
the kids today...Because I feel like everybody's responsible, especially
the kids. If they don't feel like they have to change anything or have to
make things better, nobody will.
I think having Roland in the band is.. we are as lucky as we have Michael
in the band by that time, we are lucky having Roland in the band. And he's
just doing great songs and great guitar work he's doing. And a good pal as
well. He's a nice fellow. And he just fits in the band very much. I think
the fans will accept him of course.
Well, the nice thing about Roland being in the band is that I saw him
like, I don't know, fifteen years ago or so on stage, and I thought that
was pretty impressing, what he did there, and I could never forget about
that.  And that's why actually I called him up then when we needed
another guitarist, "Remember that guy?". And so it took me, like, four hours to
find out the number, like I had to phone up musicians I knew and suddenly
somehow I got the number, and phoned him up: "You might not know me, but I
know you. How about playing guitar in Helloween?" And he didn't even know
the band. So I had to give him some examples of our songs, like really
loud, cranked it up. And so, well, he was interested, like it quite a lot.
And then we went to rehearsing, we had to do the whole stuff within two
months. 'Cause then we had to go on an American tour and Japan meant two
hours of playing. And well, ha ha, quite a tough job I would say. After
all, I mean, we can handle that, we are pretty good, you know. And I'm
sorry about that, but well... yeah, Roland is a very nice guy. He's
doing a big part of the band with his character, and his kind of being.
And it's quite a difference too how the whole thing worked before, because
he is a completely different character. He is a lot more calm and very
critical. He's always got his own opinion and that's exactly what we need.
Yeah, we recorded the album at PUK studio in Denmark, which is a very good
studio, I think, very lovely place. It's right in the middle of nowhere
but that's actually what we wanted, to really concentrate on the album.
And working with Chris was pretty cool, because he's got a very strong
sense of humor as we like it. And we had some cool moments there and
that's all caught on the album. Yeah, the production that Chris
Tsangarides has done is right in your face. That's the best description
of the sound actually. So just check it out!
Crystal clear, or...
Crystal Tsangarides clear, ha ha!
I would say thank you to everybody who kept up the faith during all that
time, and after all, those rumours are untrue.
The best thing for the fans, for the people who like us, is just to listen
what comes from us directly, like this now, and the album of course.
Yeah, especially the album.
Don't trust any rumours or whatever.
The thing is, forget about what's been in the magazines, or what has been
said, or all the stuff. And just check out the album and you know what's
going on.  Of course, the single as well.
Thanks for keeping the faith.

1. Number One
Each time when one more year was over
You refused to hear heavven's bells sound
And the happiness in you heart's been set lower
You were searching for friends but no one seemed to be 'round
You merely should think of the good times
'Cos there are so many ways you can go
Take a look at yourself, you're still very young
And big aims always take very long
Now it's time for happiness, stay hard and trust your fate
Don't forget you're something else you'll never be too late
Trust your fathers' mighty spell you'll never be alone
Fate will always turn out well and you'll be number one
Shout at the world don't care what they say
'Cos your life is now, here and today
Luck is there, ev'rywhere
Go on, reap its goods, that's the way
You wanna have truth, relief from your pain
But life takes its toll again and again
Don't fear the night--your future is paid
And the tracks to your aims are laid
Now it's time. . .
2. Les Hambourgeois Walkways
3. You Run With The Pack
To give what I got, to take what I need to live, it ain't easy for me,
Darken my eyes, tell me lies, but all nice, tell me how I have to be,
Get me in your foolish game, destroy my defence, lock me in,
Throw me in your lion's cage, 'cos then I'm out of your way,
Cry with the wolves, run with the pack,
Turn around to save your neck,
'Cos someone always keeps you in confusion,
Squeezed in a box, who'll win the race,
Ask no questions in this case,
What's left is only you and your illusions,
Charity is all your duty, they preach you: sharing your goods is your pride,
Patriotic-Love, kill the enemy first, I can hear the other side,
What's the way out of this game? You'll either win or you lose,
I run in circles, who's to blame? Is there a way I can choose?
I'm juggling on a rope without a net and hope,
I keep my balance 'cos I see them smile with open jaws,
And if I'm falling down, then I will soon be torn.
A squabble over prey: who gets the best part out of me,
To take the needle is a one-way trip without a coming back,
You take it and you still will see reality'll make upon you.

1. Pink Bubbles Go Ape
Some people are much too smart
They know everything before it starts
Eating wisdom with the pail
No wonder when it sticks
In your darkest hour I will sing this song for you
Cry and tell
And slander
Yell and grumble well
So loud for heaven's sake
Pink bubbles go ape!
2. Kids Of The Century
We poison our hearts
We poison our seas
We burn down the paradise
We're stoppin' good waves
We're losin' our trees
The future looks bright ahead
I don't wonder we'll go under in this river of lies
We're lost in this time--we create so fine
The future we already fear
Seems like no way out, seems like there's no doubt
The future looks bright ahead
We're the kids of the century--we're lost in our games
No time for the memories we look in the haze
We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault
Ev'rything's done mum, we fall
Let's keep on crying
But sometimes I don't wanna fall
Ev'rytime when you look around things will smile at you
Ev'rytime when you turn around you smell the truth
But you run away from the lies you can't say
Don't run away from the lies you can't say
We're the kids. . .
3. Back On The Streets
I've been told in the name of something
I've got to know what it means to play the game
Too many faces around they're talking
They play their parts oh, so well but who's to blame
Back on the streets, that's where we are
Building a fortress of power, yeah!  We're coming
You know better than me the rules are:
Getting better or fat in the mania
It's good to know who is who in our game
The speed is faster, it's harder to see where we are
Back on the streets. . .
Please Mister Know-how just bring me the news
I'm waiting so long for you telling me all you can tell
There's one thing about you, you're dying to prove
The master plan is yours and living with knowledge is hell
Back on the streets. . .
4. Number One
Each time when one more year was over
You refused to hear heavven's bells sound
And the happiness in you heart's been set lower
You were searching for friends but no one seemed to be 'round
You merely should think of the good times
'Cos there are so many ways you can go
Take a look at yourself, you're still very young
And big aims always take very long
Now it's time for happiness, stay hard and trust your fate
Don't forget you're something else you'll never be too late
Trust your fathers' mighty spell you'll never be alone
Fate will always turn out well and you'll be number one
Shout at the world don't care what they say
'Cos your life is now, here and today
Luck is there, ev'rywhere
Go on, reap its goods, that's the way
You wanna have truth, relief from your pain
But life takes its toll again and again
Don't fear the night--your future is paid
And the tracks to your aims are laid
Now it's time. . .
5. Heavy Metal Hamsters
There are some fellows soft and mellow
Sitting in the field and play like hell
No one knows the way it goes
But all the songs they play they sound so well
Tonight we go to see the Heavy Metal Hamsters
It must feel nice to be a Heavy Metal Hamster
Nothing sets you free like our Heavy Metal Hamsters
A 20th century Fox came by
A gold tipped cigarette high in his jaws
contracts, PDs, Nose-Bags, TV-shows
And everything with no remorse
Things are settled now for our Heavy Metal Hamsters
Fame up to your brows, oh Heavy Metal Hamster
A previously unknown lifestyle Heavy Metal Hamster
The sweet taste of success is strong
And everything inside goes wrong you see
With coloured furs, sunglasses
Tons of nuts to eat, they don't feel free
What is wrong with our Heavy Metal Hamster?
Look what they have done our Heavy Metal Hamsters
Where is the field to run for our Heavy Metal Hamsters
Some things are left undone for our Heavy Metal Hamsters
6. Goin' Home
You think I could be the one to look inside your mind
I don't think we'll have the time, so let us get in line
Another town another bed, another thing to go
By now I learned to take it cool, but I don't wanna know
My head is empty, all the stories that I've known I've told
The situation I escaped from, now it looks like gold
Anyway and anyhow we did it, it was good
But now I take the time to think 'bout ev'rything I should
'Cause after this I'm gone, the show is done
No other town or bed that lies ahead
I'll go home to what I know
I'll go home, home to you
By the time that you think 'bout it twice no spotlight makes you stay
By the time that you feel you don't know, you have to go
The plane is ready in my head, so many things to do
A few more hours till it's over I reach out for you
A kind of peace inside is growing, thinking 'bout the shows
Until the next time I'll be so much better, yes I know
Now this is it I'm gone, the show is done
No other town or bed that lies ahead
I'll go home to what I know
I'll go home, home to you
I'll go home. . .
7. Someone's Crying
What keeps on telling me to stay on the way I chose
What keeps on giving me all the strength to carry on
Give me some time, can't sleep anymore at night
I wanna show I'm here with an aim of mine
I feel strong, but someone is crying, I know
It's so hard to find a sign of a way to go
Don't need to stone my brain, I need my head for something else
I wanna live and learn, step by step I'm going on
Send me a sign, don't wanna resign too soon
What situation will come I can't endure
I feel strong, but someone is crying, I know
It's so hard to find a sign of a way to go
Send me a sign, don't wanna resign too soon
What situation will come I can't endure
8. Mankind
Here is all mankind so proud of their achievements
There is a stone that is warmer than you
Look how we stand in the stream of illusions
No one says a word
Here you laugh and there you cry
All that makes you move
There's no fear for anything
Anything but you
Animals dying for our vanity
Our world is a beautiful place to be free
Drinking the blood of the weak, it's so easy
No one hears them cry
Here you cheat and there you lie
All that makes you gain
One day we will face His throne
There's nothin' we can say
Prosperity, luxury, fast food is rising
It's the rainforest that dies
Here you laugh and there you cry
All that makes you move
Here you cheat and there you lie
All that makes you gain
9. I'm Doin' Fine CRAZY Man
Thunder, flash and lightening is working on my back
The tables in the kitchen are tryin' to break my neck
All the late night memories are leaning in my shoes
My mother's old grey leather gloves are singing loud the blues
I can taste what's in the sun
No time to waste 'cause there is none
When I feel blue I see it shine
But still it's true I'm doin' fine
You can't see me 'cause now I'm all free
Now you know I'm through
And all that's not new
Sitting on a paperback 'cause I don't know what really cracks
I'm tryin' to climb my pencil to get high
No one tells me what to do 'cause no one knows what I've been through
You don't know a thing but you can learn
It's time to touch the sky
My mind is free I fly
I can taste. . .
10. The Chance
We're living in a constant fight
Too much pressure everywhere
And all around
Don't let it pull you down
Hold on tight
Cling to your dreams
Don't you depend on someone else
Think for yourself and win the race
The chance you got comes never twice
Do your best, (and) do it right
Time will come but don't you hide
You are on your way
You're led by God but you're not a pawn
Should live your life, don't care 'bout any scorn
Just let them fool around
No need to cry
Don't give up
Try to be as smart as you can be
I know you own so much ability
11. Your Turn
Now there is this day, a lot of things are changing
Can't just kick it away, got to get things right
Sometimes it happens fast and nothin' seems to last
The thing that I once started isn't mine anymore
I guess now it's my turn
You've got a face like a child, got a mind like a woman
Your smile is warm and tender
I hear the people say that I should stay away
From you and all the problems you might bring
They'll never know--you
Nobody ever knows what to do
They'll never see you cry
They'll never know why
Now it's your turn to break free
When you want it all you've got to see
Now it's your turn to break free
When you want the life, you've got to see what it means
See the little boy holding mama's hand
His eyes can see the things we've long forgotten
The world is easy now--and somehow
He's right
Until there is this day when Mickey Mouse must go away
It's your turn to break free. . .
This world is crying to be free
This world is dying can't you see
We need a turn to do it right
We need a mind-revolution
To get away from this selfishness
Stop playing blind--break free
1. First Time
Will you first time... Will it be... I think of someone like me ?
Makes me wonder,I can show you'd neverthought you'd see.
You're like sunshine,I can feel your heat is drying out my brain,
Would you feel like... like we're having fun it Ican do the rain ?
Have you thought out your dreams, do you have some ?
Let's see if we can find some more.
Give me your fancies at random,I think we can deal with them all.
I can't wait forever, baby, open me your door,
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more.
I can see you standing there, you know you're worth the try,
Let me guide you in my spaceship and I'll surely make you have
A  R e a l  G o o d  T i m e .
Don't waste time now - you are soaking wet, so fix the things you got,
Guess you know how - and when you're done I dotta see you strut.
My desire - can I watch you rock and know which one of choose ?
I'm no liar - I could take you down and you got nothing to lose.
I don't know any better occasion, can't hold back, it's the end of the day
I don't think you're here for the first time, no problem with me anyway.
I can't wait forever, baby, open me you door,
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more.
I can see you standing there, you know we have a try,
I can feel this night is special and I surely make you have
A  R e a l  G o o d  T i m e.
I can't wait forever, baby, open me you door,
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more.
I can see you standing there, you know we have a try,
I can feel this night is special and I surely make you have
A  R e a l  G o o d  T i m e ......
2. When The Sinner
Now it's time - to shake it all up, to be free,
Now it's time - to make us some room to let us be.
Oh, it feels so bad, yes, if fells so bad,
When everything good looks so bad,
When everything right goes so wrong.
I am up - to break it all down what's in my way,
I won't stop until I am where I'm going to stay.
No one holds me back, no, no one holds me back,
Don't wanna be what I am not,
But it's gotta be myself who breaks my neck.
I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
= Over my head - look over my head =
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
= And you won't see no halo =
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
= It's driving me mad =
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know,
= I must hold it back inside =
But anyway we've got to make a stop.
When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !
In my mind - the battle goes on 'til I give up,
Will we find - the key of life we oncehave dropped ?
Do you realy care ? - Tell me you realy care !
You may find Mr. Blane, but the guilt of life burns everywhere.
Give me light to see my inside, give me light tosee my sin,
= Over my head - look over my head =
I'd never do what I regret, I've never done anything bad,
= And you won't see no halo =
You must be joking when you point at me.
Hey ! Don't you blame me ! Don't you touch me !
Won't you ever leave me be ? I wanna live! Don't wanna think!
= It's driving me mad =
Why should I give what I can drink ?
= I must hold it back inside =
When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !
Pain - I feel inside - it's such a Shame.
No one fights fair but who's to Blame ?
Might be the game of life but it ain't over.
Now ! I walk my way firm any
Now ! My conscience speaks andthere are Doubts !
But nothing's sure in life and it ain't over. Now !
I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
= Over my head - look over my head =
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
= And you won't see no halo =
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
= It's driving me mad =
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know,
= I must hold it back inside =
But anyway we've got to make a stop.
When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you ! ......
3. I Don't Wanna Cry No More
Hey, brother, I miss you so - you knoked on heaven's door,
And we won't see you anymore - it must be crazy what we're living for.
'Cause God's stopped keeping you on the ladder of you life,
I call your name with tears in my eyes.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
Life's like a walking on a high wire,
You slipped away, I've seen you dying in vein.
High as mountains seem all the problems that I have,
But when I hear your voice far away out of the dark -
You just go on and on in the back of my mind.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
Skin and bone won't touch the sky,
I hope you'll find passage out of the dark.
To the otherside of the sea and I know that I'll see you again.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
4. Crazy Cat
My little crazy cat took a train to meet his gang downtown.
They played Black Jack< Fritz played his false game too far.
A guy got up and started a gunfight.
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.
Addicted to chicks, he's got a rental tree near the nudist beach.
Oh, watch out ! Booze and ladies are his fate.
Too much sex and food and Rock'n'Roll.
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.
5. Giants
Strong and invincible, they know every rule,
Seems inconceivable anything they do.
They made us their slaves - we weren't unified,
Ever since we paid for selling our lives.
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
Deprived of our consciousness, we can't predict what's more,
Can you remember how things used to be before ?
I secretly dream of things we will be taught,
Will someone esteem for those who have fought ?
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
Strong and invincible, they know every rule,
Seems inconceivable anything they do.
Deep in our hearts we hope our dreams come true,
The only thing is "What are we to do ?"
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
Won't you say it ... Can't you feel it .. ?
6. Windmill
Time goes whenever you are, time is your guiding star,
That shines all through your life, makes you feel and move.
My dreams are out in the far, so are yours a part
Of secret fairy tales, dripped on the wings of a mystery mill.
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning -
Show me the way, take me today.
Windmill, windmill, hearts are yearning -
Longing for love and a chance to be free.
Don't feel alone and depressed, someone will come at last,
To soothe your stumbling mind, to keep it away from the evil storm.
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning -
Show me the way, take me today.
Windmill, windmill, hearts are yearning -
Longing for love and a chance to be free.
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning ...
Time goes whenever you are ...
7. Revolution Now
Well,I think it's really time again for a revolution,
Not to destroy at all costs but have a look at what's there.
Can you remember a time when water was still water,
Or are you too young to even know what we won't give to our heirs ?
Inhale the bless of science through your lungs, skin and brain !
It'll surely make our children feel a lot more sanel.
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...
I was born when April guaranteed a sexual renaissance,
And today we're all faced with death, rubbers and AIDS.
In'68 some people went out to fight for freedom,
They would never ever have thought that their children wear ties.
And if you come to San Francisco -
You're gonna meet some broken people there.
Revolution now ! Revolution now ! Revolution now ! Now !
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...
8. In The Night
In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.
I always try to makethings better, everything that has gone wrong,
Mighty plans in the right direction but very little has been done.
Everyday when I try to get forward - I find myself another mile back,
Help me fighting, help me breathing - why am I falling down instead ?
Every useful minute seems to be the thoughtof you,
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do.
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but it's true.
In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.
Free from ourselves and free form this world we may find,
The freedom we search ,'cause all that we need is inside.
The hours we waste - we may not get back for a while,
And when it gets dark - no chance will be there for atry.
When I wake up early in the morning I catch abook and jump inside,
I fill my head with a million wonders and try to fill the night with light.
The moment when I get things clearer - I see another mountain to climb.
And always when I think I'm nearer - I realize there is no time.
In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
Sometimes I cried after all Ilied to you.
9. Music
When I was a young boy I had no aim,
Neither experience - it wasn't a shame.
Most of the time it satisfied me,
But some day I realized - music is like a rising sun.
Times are now changing and memory fades,
I gaze at the photos, a look in the haze.
You cannot imagine how many friends I've lost,
It's much too late for calling them back.
Music is like sunrise for me,
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine.
Music is like sunrise for me - it's like coming home.
I was always insecure, sometimes I still am,
But I made up my mind now - and look here I stand.
I ask myself sometimes: "Is it all worth it ?"
To fly over mountains - makes you fall down again
But music is like sunrise for me,
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine.
Music is like sunrise for me - it's like coming home.
Music is like sunrise for me,
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine.
Music is like sunrise for me - it's like coming home.
10. Step Out Of Hell
Time has come, start your search for tomorrow,
No escape from that long trail of sorrow.
You don't know how it keeps going on. Oh ... No ...
Wake up out of misty dreams,
Evil drugs is starting to grab you, to grab you.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help ... But can I ?
You did your best to keep yourself down,
Give it a rest and just turn around !
It's only a one way street of lies ... Yes it is !
Living in a twilight zone,
Get away out of that drug jungle, that drug jungle.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help you.
Another line, have a good time, you don't mind
To turn you brain inside out, to serve the final rite.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help you !
11. I Believe
Give me two strong arms to fight my enemies,
Give me two eyes to see the truth.
Give me two legs I think I have to run,
And fill my heart with faith that I won't lose.
I don't wanna lose ...
Give me one real love that I don't freeze out there,
Make me feel your presence in the night.
Give me one strong heart that tells me when I lie,
And take my soul - so I won't have to hide.
I don't wanna hide ...
It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall,
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do I believe.
I Believe ... I Believe ...
It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall,
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do ...
There'll be no reason to live without you giving me light,
There is so much that you give, your love is shining so bright.
I Believe ... I Believe ... I Believe ... Believe ...
I wanna love but I always hate - I wanna give but I always take.
Want you to laugh but I make you cry, maybe I won't change 'til I die.
It's so much easier said than done - I know I can't just always run.
Got so much anger inside of me, I understand but I think I see what I'm not.
I know it's true what J.C. said - I got it all clear in my head.
Seens we were born to be unfair,
I am a sinner that's starting to dare ... to Believe.
Give me your hand until the end and I will waik into promised land.
I don't deserve anything you do - but I can't stop loving you.
No more lies, no false religions,
No more "whys" and wrong God missions.
No shiny T.V. priests begging to cash,
No more wars that no God's ever asked for.
There's a way back out of here - one day we're going home,
Tell everyone who wants to hear - whatever you do ... do Believe.
I Believe ... We Believe ... Believe ... Oh !
12. Longing
Feelings come and go - I've never known,
Something longs to grow - won't let go.
Spirits around my head - are whispering,
I turn inside instead - of wondering.
Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be,
A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit free.
If I don't wanna know - what's written inside me,
How could I see anything - how could I be anything ?
Restless minds have searched - long before,
The truth will be same - for evermore.
The mightiness of trees - that you can feel,
Can give you all you need - just listen still.
Here is love and there is pain.
It's all around, it's all the same,
There's nothing new that I cuold tell to you.
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts,
We might not know the mining yet, but I am sure we can't reject
The truth that is in everything - that is and has been and will be.
There is a long way to go - there is a high place to know,
There is a world to go through - but there's so much more to do
Until we're home !
Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be,
A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit free.
If I don't wanna know - what's written inside me,
How could I see anything - how could I be anything ?
Feelings come and go - I've never known...

1. I Don't Wanna Cry No More
Hey, brother
I miss you so
You knocked on heaven's door
And we won't see you anymore
It must be crazy
What we're living for
'Cause God's stopped keeping you
On the ladder of your life
I call your name with tears in my eyes
I don't wanna cry no more
Past gave me happiness and pain
Life is fleeting like a flower
From a distance, after sorrow
I pray the Lord to keep your soul
I don't wanna cry no more
We're still missing you
Life's like walking
On a high wire
You slipped away
I've seen you dying in a vein
High as a mountains seem all the problems that I have
But when I hear your voice Far away out of teh dark
You just go on and on in the back of my mind
I don't wanna...
Skin and bone won't touch the sky
I hop you'll find passage out of the dark
To the other side of the sea
And I know that I'll see you again
I don't wanna...
2. Red Socks And The Smell Of Trees
3. Ain't Got Nothing Better
I'm always on the run with my guitar and my old shoes
I'm movin' and I'm groovin' and I really got the blues
I'm always havin' fun and I've got nothin' left to lose
I never tune my guitar 'cause I like the way it grooves
Sitting in a sleazy bar I'm slowly goin' down
I ain't got no more money but I know you'll be around
Early in the morning and the first kiss isn't far
I ain't got nothing better than my girl and my guitar
We're rockin' and we're rolling and we don't know what we do
We play so loud and out of tune I need a new tattoo
We don't give a damn-shit we five horsemen on the run
We only wanna go out there and have a lot of fun
Take me through the night and I will always be with you
Feel me, touch me, hear me, yes I love the things we do
Love me and I show you just the way I love you too
We belong together and I never let you go
Thanks to vaingloryopera for sending these lyrics.
1. Step Out Of Hell
Time has come
Start your search for tomorrow
No escape
From that long trail of sorrow
You don't know how it keeps goin' on, oh no
Wake up out of misty dreams
Evil drug is starting to grab you, to grab you
Step out of hell - demons dancing 'round your brain
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead
Step out of hell - take my heand I wanna help (but can I?)
You did your best
To keep yourself down
Give it a rest
And jsut turn around!
It's only a one way street of lies, yes it is!
Living in a twilight zone
Get away out of that drug jungle, that drug jungle
Step out of hell - demons dancing 'round your brain
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead
Step out of hell - take my heand I wanna help you
Another line, have a good time, you don't mind
To turn your brain inside out
To serve the final rite
Step out of hell - demons dancing 'round your brain
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead
Step out of hell - take my heand I wanna help you!
2. Cut In The Middle
Ice cold Metalmonster creeping
Through the darkest night
Heart of gold and steel
Because I don't know what to write
Pins and chains and bullet-bells round my metal chest
All that shit looks good on me even if I'm getting fat
Squeeze my ass into leather pants
It needs to be so tight
Tons of beer and alcohol
It brings me through the night
Cut in the middle
Couldn't hurt me too bad if I weren't here
Can someone tell me what it's all supposed to mean
The answer isn't really clear
In a world of lines and pills that where I wanna be
Look at me I am dangerous I lost reality
I look into the mirror babe, I tell you what I see
Is my awful crabface really dirty smiling at me
And sometimes I feel so down and depressed and
What I do is to remember all the past
And my best friend will be the IOU
Cut in the middle
Couldn't hurt me too bad if I weren't here
Can someone tell me what it's all supposed to mean
The answer isn't really clear

4. Get Me Out Of Here
I can't tell you how it happened
So I guess we'll never know
I'm always late and running out of time
So I must be very slow
Someone must have smoked too much
Or is it only dust
My pals just tend to leave here in disgust
My flat is a mess same as ever before
My suits they stink like you don't wanna know
Junk to the left, trash to the right
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore
When the postman rings I stay in bed
I never make it down
My fridge must be alive inside
It's uttering funny sounds
If I don't know what time it is
I peek out if there's sun
No use anyway, my money's gone
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore

1. When The Sinner
Now it's time - to shake it all up to be free
Now it's time - to make us some room to let us be
Oh, it feels so bad
Yes it feels so bad
When everything good looks so bad
When everything right goes so wrong
I am up - to break it all down what's in my way
I won't stop - until I am where I'm going to stay
No one holds me back
No, no one holds me back
Don't wanna be what I'm not
But it's gotta be myself who breaks my neck
I here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
We keep on looking 'til we know what for
If you don't know it, I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
All of us don't know what we should know - maybe one day we'll know
But anyway we've got to make a stop
Over my head - look over my head you won't see no halo
It's driving me mad - I must hold it back inside
When the sinner searches sin, it's all of us
When we finally search inside, it's under us
We keep on looking anyway
If we don't find it who must pay?
All I've ever done I've done to you!
In my mind - the battle goes on 'til I give up
Will we find - the key of life we once have dropped?
Do you really care?
Tell me you really care!
You may find Mr. Blame
But the guilt of life burns everywhere
Give me light to see my inside, give me light to see my sin
I'd never do what I regret, I've never done anything bad
You must be joking when you point at me!
Hey! Don't you blame me! Don't you touch me!
Won't you ever leave me be?
I wanna live! Don't wanna think! Why should I give what I can drink?
Man! Life is short so I take what I need!
Over your head...
When the sinner...
Pain!
I feel inside it's such a
Shame!
No one fights fair, but who' to
Blame!
Might be the game of life but it aint' over
Now!
I walk my way firm any
How!
My conscience speaks and there are
Doubts!
But nothing's sure in lifeand it ain't over
Now!
I look here...
Over my head...
When the sinner...
2. I Don't Care You Don't Care
You took me up and you took me down
You managed not to make me frown
I met some dogs, they looked me down
And said: "You're not her only man in town"
Don't you beleive that I feel blue
'Cos I know the ones who act the way you do
You kinda ones will always stay the way you are
But I don't care, you don't care, we don't care
Shit happens - let it happen
My sister drove my Bentley home
And found she wasn't all alone
She led him in and thought she'd won
He took the car and now he's gone
Don't you believe that I feel blue
There's other thoughts and other things to do
Tho sometimes I think bad luck is going a little
Too far
But I don't care...

1. Irritation (Weik Editude 112 In C)
2. Sole Survivor
I got that fever
Burning my head
So many memories
No tear to shed
Burns like a fire
Who stole my aims?
My comrade fighters
Been sent astray
How could I know
What others had in mind for me?
How would they know
What measures I take?
Sole survivor
Of a kill without alert sing your feelings out
Your song remains unheard
Sole survivor
We shared like brothers
A light in the black
Totally blended
Bold and erect
But we've grown intriguers
Till it's too late
Time has brought fire
Fear, greed and hate
Now I'm cryin'
Shattered on the ground
All I find
Has died anyway
Sole survivor
Of a kill without alert sing your feelings out
Your song remains unheard
Sole survivor
Got a voice without a sound
Mean mistreaters
Took away your ground
Sole survivor
Sole survivor...
3. Where The Rain Grows
I never looked higher
Than I could see
Never gave less
Than I have given me
The more you have taken
You turned into fakes
I finally know how
Why for heavens'sake?
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that is someone's made dumb to the core
He would stay like before
So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
Now you call me liar
'Cause you are just the
"Always-have-right-
fools-majority"
I think that if someone
Starved at your side
You'd all turn your back
Won't give any dime
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that is someone's made sad to the core
He would stay like before
So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
I know where the rain grows
I'm back from where the rain grows
4. Why?
Father, it's time
Have a heart for your child who cries in pain
Not a new sign
But I strike that'll blow those fools away
Open your eyes
If you've got any you just look for too long a time
They spit on your name
Doin' everything you darnned as highest crime
They believe they could walk on the water
Playing 'god, sleep with the devils' daughter
Killed your son and might kill mine
But you don't mind
Why, Lord, why
Tell me why
In these lonely days
I'd need your answer
There's a reason why
How could you fail?
Still it's time, turn the black into the light
Why do you wait?
Do you look down and laugh at what you find?
Can't you see they are mistreating their daughters
They believe they could walk on the waters
They killed your son and might kill mine
But you don't mind
Why, Lord, why
Tell me why
In these lonely days
I'd need your answer
There's a reason why
Why, Lord, why
Tell me why
Your the only light
Forever lasting
Tell me, father, why
Why, Lord, why
Tell me why
In these lonely days
I'd need your answer
There's a reason why
Why, Lord, why
Tell me why
Your the only light
Forever lasting
Tell me, father, why
Father, it's time
Father, it's time...
5. Mr. Ego (Take Me Down)
Take me down
To the ground
Just let me feel it
If I let someone down
Please welcome
Him on the losing side
I shake you off
And make my choice
Don't wanna hear you
Your slimy voice
Please go down, please
I don't wanna feel you around me
Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin' down
I feel that man
On my back
Don't promise any crap
Someone will break your neck
You don't know how
To soak my soul
Let me out
Let me go
Open your eyes
You told nothing  but lies
Please go down, please
C'mon, go down with your ego
Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin' down
Let me go ahead, let me go
I will find an explanation
Where's my only destination
Separated ways now and forever
Is the only and only measure
Tales full of exaggerations
No more manipulations
And I think you are not funny
Your brain is just a bloated dummy
Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin' down
6. Perfect Gentleman
There is no doubt about it
I'm one of kind, baby
I am le d'Artagnan de coeur
As you may see, candy
And I'm talking with my eyes
And I walk in different styles
I'm the genuine man!
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Kneel down, inhale my odor
Come, kiss my hand, angel
Dare to explore my higher grounds
Strive to deserve me, ma cherie
And my winds surpass perfume
I'm charismatic at fool bloom,
I'm the genuine man
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am, I am, yes I am
(perfect)
Oh, Lord, what can I do?
I can't resist my own reflection
How would possibly anyone?
Cause I am (perfect)
Yes I am (perfect)
Oh, Lord,  I am (perfect)
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
7. The Game Is On
Have you seen this little toy
When you're down it gives you joy
You escape reality
Delve into its TV screen
For the rich and for the poor
For the even more secure
Doesn't matter where you are,
Where you go or when you been
Well, there's still no guarantee
For your virgin mind, you see
Just go on and play the game
You will surely go insane
The game is on
And you have gone
Gone to a world on its display
And the game is fun
But when it has won
All you ever hear is what it says
There's a great amount of fumes
Coming out from somebody's room
The firemen got there
Walking their way up the stairs
Find a man in a chair
But it doesn't seem he's there
With a grey box in his hands
He has gone to another land
The game is on
And you have gone
Gone to a world on its display
And the game is fun
But when it has won
All you ever hear is what it says
You have played it much too long
Now your senses get things strong
All your walls come crashing down
Now it's time for you to frown
How d'you like this heavy load?
Guess your brain will soon explode
You  never had this ugly feel
It's time to dial an emergency
8. Secret Alibi
Piece by piece you're tearin' me apart
Give to me and try another start
Brick by brick you really love this game
Things from which I can't refrain
So many stories have been told
I give a damn, they're much too old
How often will we face the end of our dreams?
When will I see it all come true?
A splendid time for me and you
Can we expect it bein' nice as it seems?
Will you be my secret alibi
Angel of my nights
Can we do it right?
Let's just try each others love so sweet
Till we can't deny my secret alibi
Ding by ding can you dig my dong
It may come short but it might come long
Limb by limb you're climbing on my tree
Making things more fun for me
So many stories I've been told
I give a damn, they're much too old
How often will we face the end of our dreams?
When will I see it all come true?
A splendid time for me and you
Can we expect it being nice as it seems?
Will you be my secret alibi
Angel of my nights
Can we do it right?
Let's just try each others love so sweet
Till we can't deny my secret alibi
Will you be my secret alibi
Angel of my nights
Can we do it right?
Let's just try each others love so sweet
Till we can't deny my secret alibi
9. Take Me Home
Now I'm here all alone
Takin' care of my own
Down in no man's land
Got no friend, got no dime
Only plenty of time
Where's the saving hand?
I got that feeling to need more and more attention
That is the fever, don't leave me alone
I got that feeling to make more than conversation
That is the fever, where's my home?
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
It's not true - what you see
Behind that mask that's not me
Try to reach my world
Can't you see I'm so blind
Stay with me to change my mind
No more nightmares, girl
I got that feeling to need more and more attention
That is the fever, don't leave me alone
I got that feeling to make more than conversation
That is the fever, where's my home?
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
I got that feeling to need more and more attention
That is the fever, don't leave me alone
I got that feeling to make more than conversation
That is the fever, where's my home?
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
10. In The Middle Of A Heartbeat
Tell me, pretty girl, do you know who I am?
Have you ever seen me as your friend?
Anything we have is those hungry nights
But there's so much left unsatisfied
All those little things you told me
Ain't good enough to show me
That we're gonna make it through the time
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm doin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart
Now that I'm afraid just to ask for more
I'm still waiting as I did before
If you only said that it's not too late
We could then rely upon our fate
All those little things you'd tell me
Could bear enough to show me
That we're gonna make it through the time
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm tellin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart
I found out
I found out
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm tellin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to br your light
I can't get any closer to your heart
11. Still We Go
In the beginning
Out of nowhere
We had a dream
And Now It's Helloween
Speed up to a higher limit
Change gear, we're losin' our spirit
We won't take your special advice
We are close to a metal breakdown
Sirens to warn of our meltdown
We couldn't see that headline
Now we can see a horizon
We're gonna be here to stay
If you cannot see our sign
You must be blind
Still we go
Still we go
Still we go
On the metal highway
Still we go
Warn out, won't die on our knees
Shine on, proud as we can be
Time has come to stop pleasing you
Hey man, Let's get it together
Our strength will last forever
Push us as far as we can go
Now we can see a horizon
We're gonna be here to stay
If you cannot see our sign
You must be blind
Still we go
Still we go
Still we go
On the metal highway
Still we go
How many times must a man cross the lines
To find his right way
Still we go
Still we go
Still we go
On the metal highway
Still we go

I never looked higher
Than I could see
Never gave less
Than I have given me
The more you have taken
You turned into fakes
I finally know now
Why, for heavens' sake?
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind

He would stay like before
So I take my life

Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
I know where the rain grows
I'm Back from where the rain grows
3. Can't Fight Your Desire
He's got the woman
Out Of Your Dreams
You'll never find out
What it all means
But you've got patience
And still believe
That you'll be there
When she will leave
Someone will lose
Somebody's finding
Somebody smiles
Somebody's crying
Can't fight
You can't fight your desire
You can't fight your dreams, yeah
You can't fight your desire
Hold on to your dreams, yeah
So listen hard now
Man you should know
If you're just waiting
Your doubts will grow
You self-believe
Already small
Get up now
You can have it all
Someone will lose
Somebody's finding
Somebody smiles
Somebody's crying
Can't fight
You can't fight your desire
You can't fight your dreams, yeah
Can't fight
You can't fight your desire
Hold on to your dreams, yeah
Someone will lose
Somebody's finding
Somebody smiles
Somebody's crying
Can't fight
You can't fight your desire
You can't fight your dreams, yeah
Can't fight
You can't fight your desire
Hold on to your dreams, yeah
4. Star Invasion
There he's sitting in his cockpit
Out on guard, ten thousand miles from home
Lookin' through his little window
Earth appears as God's blue magic dome
Just a little bit disturbing
Are those coloured spaceships
Closing in
Star Invasion
From behind the sun
Destination
Straight into his face
Seven years they taugh and told him
What to do and how to act right now
He would have to push a button
In his panic he just don't know how
Seems like there's no red alert no more
And so that squirrel wasn't there before
Star invasion
From behind the sun
Complication
Say what can be done?
Near to a thousand-eight squirrels beam aboard and say hello
Puke and shit his control board, dematerialize and steer their ships
Away from earth
Star invasion
Praise the Lord they're gone
Mere pollution
Cleaning up's no fun
Star invasion
First touch with a different kind
Ausser Spesen nix gewesen IIII

2. Cold Sweat
I put my money in the suitcase
And headed for the big race
I felt a chill on my backbone
As I hung up the telephone
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win pays double
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat
They say chances on the outside
Are looking very slim
I've been so lucky on the inside
I feel I'm going to win
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
Take a little money, there's nothing left to lose
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat
I've got me a whole month's wages
I haven't seen that much in ages
I might spend it in stages
And move out to Las Vegas
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win means double
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat
I put my money in the suitcase
They say chances on the outside
I got a whole months wages
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Stone cold crazy
Place another bet
3. Silicon Dreams
Daily in the news and on the screen
they wanna show you how to look like
how to be a star
But if you bignosed without muscles
you are not attractive
you don't fit in what's so popular
Four pounds too much without a suntang
selfrespect is fading
they already tooked away your pride
California dreamgirl with her brain down in her pussy
you will never reach her you're too small
Wake up all you idiots don't close your eyes
and see there is only one thing you can be
this is just you and nothing else
start to believe all in yourself
stop to running after visions you don't need
who is in the mirror
do you really trust this face
smiles at you so bad and ugly
this is not yourself anymore
will a soul feel well in plastic bodies
where it don't belong
silicon and lifted faces
don't you really know who you are
Don't try to hide
if you don't look like Monroe
the smile on your face this is real
just be yourself that's the deal
California dreamman
with a smile made out of plastic
juicy woman dreams that you can buy
selling you a dream so far away
and so fantastic until you realise you won't get high
Now you're close to suicide
your dream bursts like a bubble
all the gossip you once liked is gone
your addiction to be skinny is driving you to madness
I hope now you can see what you have done

Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart
I found out
I found out
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm doin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat ...
3. I Stole Your Love
Alright
I remember the day that we met
I needed someone you needed someone too
Spent time taking all you could get
Even yourself was one thing you never could do
You played with my heart
You played with my head
I've got to laugh when I think all things you said
Cause I stole your love
Stole your love
Ain't never going to let you go
I stole your love
Stole your love
You never stop running around
You pick me up and say you want some of me
Down
You were the girl that nobody could own
You stay for a while and then you would leave me alone
But I'm something different - ain't like the rest
How does it feel to find out your failing your test
Cause I stole your love
Stole your love
Ain't never going to let you go
I stole your love
Stole your love
Guitar!
Listen!
Cause I stole your love
Stole your love
Ain't never going to let you go
I stole your love
Stole your love
I stole your love
Stole your love
Stole your love
Come on
I stole your love
4. Closer To Home
Everybody listen to me
And return me
My Ship
I'm your captain
I'm your captain
No I'm feeling mighty sick
I've been lost now
Days uncounted
And it's months since
I've seen home
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Oh am I all alone
If you return me
To my home port
I will kiss you
Mother Earth
Take me back now
Take me back now
To the port
Of my birth
To the port
Of my birth
Am I in my cabin dreaming
Or are you really schemeing
To take my ship away from me?
You better think about it
I just can't live without it
So please don't take my ship from me
Yeah yeah yeah
I can feel the hand
Of the stranger
As it's tightening
Around my throat
Heaven help me
Heaven help me
Take this stranger
>From my boat
I'm your captain
I'm your captain
Though I'm feeling mighty sick
Everybody listen to me
And return me my ship
I'm your captain
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm getting closer to my home

1. Forever And One (Neverland)
What can I do?
Will I be getting through?
Now that I must try to leave it all behind
Did you see what you have done to me?
So hard to justify
Slowly it's passing by
Forever and one
I will miss you
However, I kiss you
Yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard I was trying
Tomorrow I'll still be crying
How could you hide your lies
Your lies
Here I am
Seeing you once again
My mind's so far away
My heart's so close to stay
Too proud to fight
I'm walking back into night
Will I ever find someone to believe?
Forever and one
I will miss you
However, I kiss you
Yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard I was trying
Tomorrow I'll still be crying
How could you hide your lies
Your lies
2. In The Middle Of A Heartbeat (Live)
Tell me pretty girl, do you know how I am?
Have you ever seen me as your friend?
Anything we have is those hungry nights
But there's so much left unsatisfied
All those little things you told me
Ain't good enough to show me
That we're gonna make it through the time
I found out
In the middle of a  heartbeat
And I know that I'm doin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart
Now that I'm afraid just to ask for more
I'm still waiting as I did before
If you only said that it's not too late
We could then rely upon your fate
All those little things you'd tell me
Could bear enough to show me
That we're gonna make it through the time
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm tellin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart
I found out
I found out
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm doin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat ...
3. Light In The Sky
There's a light in the sky
Shining all a life for one heart
There's a light in the sky
That will lead you when we're apart
All my love's shining
To lead you when you're gone
All my love's shining
To say you're not alone
There's a light in the sky
For everyone who believes
There's a light in the sky
Giving mind everlasting peace
All my love's shining
To lead you when you're gone
All my love's shining
To say you're not alone
There's a light in the sky
There's a light in the sky
4. Time Goes By
I saw a million people cry
I heard so little laughter
Tasted so many tears of mine
Still didn't feel good after
Sometimes I just wish
To turn back time
But if I could there is no world
No world that I just want to see
In my mind And time goes by
Passing by my eyes
And I still wait here for better
Time goes by
Deaf to pain and cries
And I still wait here for better
For better
Forever

1. Power
Can you imagine someone being true
Turn `round and put himself in front of you
Sometimes it's fun but then you never know
How far a thing like this might go
All my life I've waited for a chance
To get right out of here
And when I had it in my hands
I could not let it go
We've got the power, we are divine
We have the guts to follow the sign
Extracting tension from sources unknown
We are the ones to cover the throne
Try if you can to come where we have gone
You may achieve what can't be simply done
Look back and there you are where we have been
And still there's so much inbetween
All those years I've travelled `round this world
Now I am standing here
To make you sing these tunes
And know they'll never let you go
We've got the power, we are divine
We have the guts to follow the sign
Extracting tension from sources unknown
We are the ones to cover the throne
We've got the power, we are divine
We have the guts to follow the sign
Extracting tension from sources unknown
We are the ones to cover the throne
We've got the power, we are divine
2. We Burn
Climb down my pile
And again to the beat of my heart
You're so exciting
Take all the soul
I will give you as much as you want
Control my feelings
Higher, much higher
Unbounded fire
Closer, much closer
Close to the core
We burn, we burn
I contaminate you
I like to pollute you with my
G-g-generations
Look in my eyes
And we melt into on yearning mind
We climb the stages
Higher, much higher
Unbounded fire
Closer, much closer
Close to the core
We burn, we burn
Insanity, insanity
Never set me free
3. Rain
How can I see what I'm leaving for?
How can I give what I gave before?
How can you tell me that you want me to stay?
How can I stay when I'm trying to say,
That I can't live without the rain,
Yes I cant live without the rain.
How can I feel what I'm trying to feel,
How can I move when I'm heel to heel,
You're always shouting about the doubt in my eye,
But I can't answer cos my eyes are so dry.
Now I can't live without the Rain.
Yes I can't live without the Rain.
I cant live without the rain,
That's falling on my head,
Rain that's falling on my head.
Rain that's falling,
Rain that's falling,
Rain that's falling on my head.
I'd started thinking back to you when,
I'd like to send a line but then again,
How can I write you when there aint no light,
I'm feeling tight tonight but that's alright.
Now I can't live without the rain,
Yes I can't live without the rain.
4. Walk Your Way
I see black, I see white
I see the darkness and the light
Life goes up, life goes down
I am the hero and the clown
(I live it up) - yeah
(Won't give it up)
I want it all don't wanna fall
(I live it up - won't give it up)
(I want it all don't wanna fall)
I'm pretty sure there must be something worth living for
(Walk Your Way) Don't let them tear you apart
(Walk Your Way) Don't let them change you
You are here to live and what you take you've got to give
(Walk your way) It's just a signal from your heart
(Walk your way) Sometimes it strange though
Life is such a game, don't give it up
Cuz it will never be the same
I'm smoking, I'm soaking
Till there is nothing left to lose
Shit stinks and really smells bad
Step into it - makes you upset
(I live it up) - oh yeah
(Won't give it up)
I want it all don't wanna fall, yeah!
(I live it up) - oh yeah
(Won't give it up)
(I want it all don't wanna fall)
I'm pretty sure there must be something worth living for
(Walk Your Way) Don't let them tear you apart
(Walk Your Way) Don't let them change you
You are here to live and what you take you've got to give
(Walk your way) It's just a signal from your heart
(Walk your way) Sometimes it strange though
Life is such a game, don't give it up
Cuz it will never be the same
(whoa oh oh oh oh) yeah
(whoa oh oh oh oh) So many different things are waiting to be done
(whoa oh oh oh oh)
(whoa oh oh oh oh) So many things but you can put your ears into the sound
(whoa oh oh oh oh) hey
(whoa oh oh oh oh) Just take your time and you will never be too late
(whoa oh oh oh oh)
(whoa oh oh oh oh) Just take your time don't try to change your fate
(Walk Your Way) Don't let them tear you apart
(Walk Your Way) Don't let them change you
You are here to live and what you take you've got to give
(Walk your way) It's just a signal from your heart
(Walk your way) Sometimes it strange though
Life is such a game, don't give it up
Cuz it will never be the same

2. Steel Tormentor
Headless
The machine down
Coming to the low sound
Feeling like a real man
Racing
Flashing from down under
Flesh and blood and thunder
Trembling wheel in cold wheel in cold hand
Faster, much faster- wot a human speed disaster
Deeper, much deeper- on through the void I cast'er
I'm a steel tormentor
And I speed 'round ev'ry curve
I'm a mean imperator
Of my intimate machine
Turkey
Near to devastation
Losing all my patience
Cannot make this kit fly
Danger
Muscular contraction
Out for satisfaction
Mere intoxication
Nightride, it's nightride- try to catch my taillights
So sad, I'm so sad, but you won't ever suck my steel bride
I'm a steel tormentor
And I speed 'round ev'ry curve
I'm a mean imperator
Of my intimate machine
3. Wake Up The Mountainn
Some people die
And even never realize
Man's growing blind
Is seeing only with the eyes
We think we're strong
Believe we never could be wrong
But we are fools
Because we are dying by the rules
Though I cannot change the world we're living in
I can always change myself
One more to count in
Wake up the moutain
All colour's slowly turning to grey
Our world is darkling
Wake up the mountain
And we will find it once more again
Cash and careers
Built on countles sums of fears
All good of life
Begin to vanish behind tears
How do we know
Why did we choose the way we follow
Why do we hurt
Why do we hurt the ones we love
Though I cannot change the world we're living in
I can always change myself
One more to count in
Wake up the moutain
All colour's slowly turning to grey
Our world is darkling
Wake up the mountain
And we will find it once more again
Once more again
We made the rules and we can change them
Break down the orders on by one
We made the laws and we can break them
Break down the mountain
Stone by stone by stone by stone
4. Power
Can you imagine someone being true
Turn `round and put himself in front of you
Sometimes it's fun but then you never know

To make you sing these tunes and know they'll never let you go
We've got the power, we are divine
We have the guts to follow the sign
Extracting tension from sources unknown
We are the ones to cover the throne
5. Forever And One (Neverland)
What can I do?
Will I be getting through?
Now that I must try to leave it all behind
Did you see what you have done to me?
So hard to justify
Slowly it's passing by
Forever and one I will miss you
However, I kiss you yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard I was trying
Tomorrow I'll still be crying
How could you hide your lies
Your lies
Here I am
Seeing you once again
My mind's so far away
My heart's so close to stay
Too proud to fight
I'm walking back into night
Will I ever find someone to believe?
Forever and one I will miss you
However, I kiss you yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard I was trying
Tomorrow I'll still be crying
How could you hide your lies
Your lies
6. Before The War
Come take a look up to the constellations
Take the book of God you will find your relations
If you understand you will know the solution
Things will fall back to the new constitution
I'm a son of a distant future
I'm the last of the seven troopers
And I came here for the 7th war
I'm a child of the stars
The blaster of the gods
And I have seen it all before
Before the war
Cold-hearted earth
I'm the master of the universe
And I have seen it all before
Before the war
Nature sets a limit on your millenary
Turning every place into a cruel mean scenary
All will get a chance to shun the holy file
But you will be few getting under the wire
I'm a son of a distant future
I'm the last of the seven troopers
And I came here for the 7th war
I'm a child of the stars
The blaster of the gods
And I have seen it all before
Before the war
Cold-hearted earth
I'm the master of the universe
And I have seen it all before
Before the war
Mind the seventh war - mind the seventh war
Yes I came here for the seventh war
7. A Million To One
Born into somewhere unseen and unknown
Just like a wonder so small and alone
Take me away into your innocent dreams
Maybe I'd see what it all means
A million to one
You will lose it all
A million to one
You'll be falling
Down to where I am
An unholy man
A million to one
You'll be falling
It's so sad and so true but what can I do
Only a few years then it's up to you
To care for yourself, I hope I gave good advice
For all your life, how to survive
A million to one
You will lose it all
A million to one
You'll be falling
Down to where I am
An unholy man
A million to one
You'll be falling
8. Anything My Mama Don't Like
I'm no believer
I just listen to my own head
I'm no believer
I just call you liar instead
Keep all your sorrows
Words might be pathetically vain
Life is a fire
Light it and you can read your name
I'm the king of the night generation
I'm anything my mama don't like
I'm a slave of perverted nation
Anything my mama don't like
I am a flyer
Rising in the wake of my dreams
I am a tumbler
Life can be as good as it seems
I'm a child playing chess with tomorrow
I'm anything my mama don't like
I'm a clown and I beg, steal and borrow
Anything my mama don't like
I'm the king of the night generation
I'm anything my mama don't like
I'm a slave of perverted nation
Anything my mama don't like
9. Kings Will Be Kings
All you have said is still in my ears
You must have thought you're infallible
Oh no oh no
You're not gonna say that much anymore
Welcome to my peculiar dream
Fact is that I'm here I'm the master of reality
Hard to see?
But it's real and you will read me
So many ways to go
Before we're sanctified
Few will be chosen ones
Until we fade and die
Kings will be kings
Pawns will be pawns
Aeons of tears
Wild and severe
Blessed be the young
Strong enough to bear
What before long
Will come, Will be, might never disappear
I know that pride's before the fall
How can I fall if there's none left at all
Tell me tell me
How far can one fall from down below?
It's either time or ev'ryone round
To show us what or who might be exchangable
Disposable
In the game of life we're playing
Close to eternity
I spread my wings and fly
Like from a distant age
I rule and you obey
Kings will be kings
Pawns will be pawns
Aeons of tears
Wild and severe
Blessed be the young
Strong enough to bear
What before long
Will come, Will be, might never disappear
10. Mission Motherland
So far from our system we came here through space
To leave poisoned spheres for your race
Our knowledge we trade for the time shared on earth
To take and give for what it's worth
On, our screens we've been shown your world
Plead for your welcome, you won't get hurt
Mission motherland
Another chance
With sunlit soil and air to breathe
Is there any place for us to live
To grow descendants
To be free
You gave us resources
You gave us advice
To deal with the unknown to get humanized
We've shown you dimensions and brought you on ways
You've never seen yesterday
Hand in hand we will march through time
So much more to research and find
Mission motherland
Another chance
With sunlit soil and air to breathe
Is there any place for us to live
To grow descendants
To be free
When you hear these words
We've taken cold refuge
In freezers to keep us alive
What we didn't know
Your central star called sun
Sends lethal rays to earth
Say how many of us died
In the streams of light
Faceless bodies, morbid cries
Doomed our colonies
Wake us when you've healed the world
Save our souls
When will we be as one again
And fulfill what we understand as
11. If I Knew
Loneliness seems like an evil dream
But reality is life and life is here
Once my heart was ruled by emptiness
Harmed because of being too sincere
But now that you've crossed my way
Could it be we found it again
If I knew that I'm your only one
I could live and make it through time
But if one day you'd just be gone
I wouldn't know how to ever get by
How can I make you feel secure
We're both the same, I'm king and you are queen
Understand you make me breathe again
Tell me all your thoughts and I will see
Take my hand and we'll be there
Together, someday, somewhere
I wouldn't know how to ever get by
I wouldn't know how to ever get by
I would simply break down and cry
12. The Time Of The Oath
In a circle of fire
On a cold winter night
I spoke out my desire
Made a promise
I couldn't hide, no!
In a dream
He came along and told me "Your time has come Your mind
belongs to me"
It's the time of the oath
The time of the oath
My sweetest memories die in the cold
It's the time of the oath
See me covered with sadness
And I'll soon wish to die
When that overcoming madness
Is eating up my mind
Here and now
I look back at a good time
No more lie - I slowly say goodbye
It's the time of the oath
The time of the oath
My sweetest memories die in the cold
It's the time of the oath
In a dream
He came along and told me "Your time has come Just slowly say good-bye"
It's the time of the oath
The time of the oath
My sweetest memories die in the cold
It's the time of the oath
Di-es i-rae, di-es il-la
Sol-vet sae-cium in fa-villa
Quan-tus tre-mor est fu-tu-rus
Quan-do ju-dex est ven-turus
13. Still I Don't Know
I'm Asking Here
I'm asking there
And we all seem to share
Different gains for life
Though We'll all arrive
At the big end somewhere
But we don't know whats more when its over
Is there heaven or hell?
I wonder if there's something when my time's
Run out in life
Still I don't know, Still I don't Know
Wonder if there's music, rubbersex
And a Mac Drive
Still I don't know, Still I don't know
All we know is here
What we lone and fear
Its a question of time
When all is said and done
When we're dead and gone
We'll just disappear
Yes We don't know whats more when its over
Is there heaven or hell?
I wonder if there's something
My Lifes run out of time
Still I don't know, Still I don't know
Wonder If there's smokers
Even in "Deutsche Bahn
Still I don't know, Still I don't know
Wonder if there's something
Like a cigarette or some wine
Wonder if I'm lonely
If i'll meet a friend of mine
Still I don't know, Still I don't know.......
14. Take It To The Limit
Been here just long enough to see what trip you're on
Suffered from your ugly deeds
The way you're pushin all, Oh No
Better watch out what you're doing
Better take some rest or get right of here, oh yeah
Haven't you hurt the people tryin to be your friend
You take it to the limit, you take it to the top
You take it to the limit, until you get stopped
You take it to the limit, you take it to the top
Stop! Stop!
You think you're somebody
But you'll never be
On the back of others
You're just acting
Like a thief, oh yeah
Better watch out what you're sayin
Better take your hat and get right out of here
Didn't you lose all the people
Tryin to be your friend
You take it to the limit, you take it to the top
You take it to the limit, til you get stopped
You take it to the limit, til you get shot, stop it!
Take it to the limit, take it to the top
Take it to the limit, til you get stopped
Take it to the limit, get out of my head!

1. Deliberately Limited Preliminary Prelude Period In Z
2. Push
They're spending millions for your thrill
Collective desperate overkill
Wrapped up in harmless words that grin
Forbidden games you'll never win
The more you see the more you know
Intended media mind control
Shut down and see how beautiful life can be
This is the prime of your lifetime
You see through eyes of someone else
More than the half of your lifetime
Is just a tale in a storybook
Push, enforce your independence
Push your real intention
Face your unconscious addiction
Push your private fiction
Push
It's getting sicker frame by frame
You're always staring at the same
What is a lie, what is the truth?
Incredible disgudting news
The world is rough, the end is near
Just calculation with your fear
Without a shame nor least respect
The operators stand erect
This is the prime of your lifetime
You see through eyes of someone else
More than the half of your lifetime
Is just a tale in a storybook
Push, enforce your independence
Push your real intention
Face your unconscious addiction
Push your private fiction
Push
3. Falling Higher
I thought that I felt alright with my world
But now what I knew seems taken by someone
Probing me, waiting if I take the bait
Surrender, step into the line
We won't give into the false
We are not as dull as taken
some will hold out if they can
They must kill us if they want us to fall
When we unite
We're falling higher
When worlds collide
We'll stand straight in turmoil and fear
No harm coming near
Hungry forever since we took a glance
Feared that the world was taken by someone
We realized by the look in your eyes
Metal will never die
With magic in our hands
We are lost-and-found contenders
For a kingdom of our stand
Come together no surrender at all
With magic in our hands
We are lost-and-found contenders
For a kingdom of our stand
Come together no surrender at all
When we unite
We're falling higher
When worlds collide
We'll stand straight in turmoil and fear
No harm coming near
No harm coming near
No harm coming near
We're falling higher
4. Hey Lord!
(What is it all about?)
Pleasure or pain
Cold or fire
Love against disdain
Hope or dipair
Truth or liar
Normal or insane
Do you know wat to choose?
It can't happen you lose
Like the stars need the light
No left without right
Hey lord, hey lord
Life is striking as you taught
Hey lord, hey lord
Time is running, time is short
Hey lord (What is it all about?)
Good or profane
Odd or even
All is face to face
Sinner and saint
Serve each other
Life is called this place
Do you know what to choose?
It can't happen you lose
Like the stars need the light
No left without right
Hey lord, hey lord
Life is striking as you taught
Hey lord, hey lord
Time is running, time is short
Hey lord
Hey lord, hey lord
Time is running, time is short
Hey lord, hey lord
Life is striking, life is short
Hey lord, hey lord
Time is running, time is short
Hey lord, hey lord
Why did you want us so wayward?
Refrain (what is it all about?)
5. Don't Spit On My Mind
Every lie will win a prize
Love sold by a whore
Calculated sacrifice
Death without a war
Aftermath and alibies
Straw-doll-chess to please the poor
Don't tell me of any wonders shitting gold
Don't tell me of a hard way we have to go through
Still we pay your warmth out of the cold
Do you really think we're that blind?
Don't spit on my mind
Don't spit on my mind
Don't spit on my mind
Any form of government
Has a black sheep part
But the brave will never know
What the black sheeps start
In the name of country-love
they enrich themselves apart
Don't tell me of any wonders shitting gold
Don't tell me of a hard way we have to go through
Still we pay your warmth out of the cold
Do you really think we're that blind?
Don't spit on my mind
Don't spit on my mind
Don't spit on my mind
We are the people, we are the masses you are for
We give the power and our desire must be your law
Don't think I'm standing here all alone, one of a kind
Do't think because you're still there
Means that we are all blind
Don't spit on my mind
Don't spit on my mind
Don't spit on my mind
6. Revelation
Now we chase the end of time
Afraid what we will find
Once again since Jesus Christ
The stars look down on mankind
Revelation
Overcome creation
False illusions
Fade and die
Whatever we awaited
Charity and hatred
Whatever we awaited
Will arise
It's revelation
Revelation
Power and prosperity
It won't be like before
Name, rank and authority
Not counting anymore
Revelation
Overcome creation
False illusions
Fade and die
Whatever we awaited
Charity and hatred
Whatever we awaited
Will arise
It's revelation
Revelation
Bemoan your words
Bemoan your deeds
Repent your thoughts of lies
Attain your sword
Attain your shield
Defend the sense of life
Bemoan your hate
Repent your greed
Improve your rotten seed
Pray for the child
Though born just by a fraud and a whore
Pray for the child
Who won't know what it's crying for
Revelation
Overcome creation
False illusions
Fade and die
Whatever we awaited
Charity and hatred
Whatever we awaited
Will arise
It's revelation
Revelation
7. Time
Feel it running off
So strong and clear
An age is over fast
And dissapears
Help him if you can
His hour will come soon
Push away his fear
He'll see Elysium
It's time
It's time
Guard him a little while
And calm his shiver
Wash and dry his tears
And cool his fever
Take the bibles words
Speak it pure his soul
Lay love in his mind
His close to the final goal
It's time
It's time
It's time to go
Time for the freedom
Time to face what we all believe in
Pray strong
Pray to the higher
Turn your back on the devil's fire
Time to go
Time for the freedom
Time to face what we all believe in
Time is passing by
When his mind was clear
He called you brother
Now his brain is dazed
It's resigning rather
Mother take his hand
Say a last Good-Bye
We're not gifted to
Turn water into wine
It's time
It's time
It's time to go
Time for the freedom
Time to face what we all believe in
Pray strong
Pray to the higher
Turn your back on the devil's fire
Time to go
Time for the freedom
Time to face what we all believe in
Time is passing by
8. I Can
May I take you higher
Feed well your desire
We won't be forgotten
Foes left slain and rotten
I will have my way as once before
Others stand in awe can't scorn at all
I can, I can, I can make it all again
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna go down
I can, I can, I can make the call again
Fulfill my dreams until I'm cured
I can
Will I be the flyer
Keep you more inspired
Some will leave here shattered
Wish us tarred and feathered
Show me anyone who doubts our ways
I will laugh out loud and I will say
I can, I can, I can make it all again
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna get drowned
I can, I can, I can heed the call again
Can attain ev'rything to leave you sure
I can
Leave me waiting years or strike today
Trample down the walls and pave your way
I can, I can, I can.........
Fulfill my dreams until I'm cured
9. A Handful Of Pain
I still remember every hour
Every second has been ours
Far away from any burden
We met eyes without a curtain
Headless into a new sensation
Wether brain nor fear or patience
Careless we had a game to play
You crossed my way for twenty days
Why don't you just heal
The yearning that I feel?
Hey, what we called a game
Is more than just a handful of pain
We go the wrong ways
Cause I believe it's more than just a handful of pain
We go the wrong ways
Cause I believe it's more than just a handful of pain
We're different colours, different nature
Both we were like pupil and teacher
It's a puzzle with two pieces
Still not done 'cause one still misses
Helpless I go through unknown stages
A chapter of life which has missing pages
Torture's not only physical
It painds unbound
Way, way down
Why don't you just heal
The yearning that I feel?
Hey, what we called a game
Is more than just a handful of pain
We go the wrong ways
Cause I believe it's more than just a handful of pain
We go the wrong ways
Cause I believe it's more than just a handful of pain

11. Back On The Ground
We can race over the mountains
Sail over the spheres
We can ride under the oceans
But we can't fight our fear
Something's wrong with the world these days
Do you know what it is?
We believe to govern nature
Find ways to lenghten our life
And we go through digital stages
Still the children cry
Something's wrong with the world these days
Do you know what it is?
The planet could be a better place
If we spot the miss
But I guess I would see a start
And I will sing it loud
WON'T YOU PUT YOUR FEET BACK ON THE GROUND
We explore the existence of aliens
Try to conquer space
We refine nuclear science
Still to die in the haze
Something's wrong with the world these days
Do you know what it is?
The planet could be a better place
If we spot the miss
But I guess I would see a start
I warn you without doubt
WON'T YOU PUT YOUR FEET BACK ON THE GROUND
12. Midnight Sun
Tried so hard to understand all of your feelings
Tried to cope with your insanities
Come to think about too many ways of healing
What we lost or maybe never had
One small step into the hidden decoy
One more word is help and one will destroy
I woke up in the midninght sun
So aware damage has been done
Agony or sanctuary
Only fate will show the way
From the bright of day into the jaw of darkness
One is shoved, a victim of a lie
Friendly face turns into a fiery grimace
Suddenly feelings learn to die
Used up sympathy no chance to return
To a world one knew but wounds that will burn
Spent more time in the midnight sun
Still aware of what else has gone
Agonized and hypnotized
When will I be shown the way
Fell asleep and no midnight sun
Still aware justice has bee done
No more doubts but disbelief
When the night was day
Celebration, miracle
And fate did show the way
13. A Game We Shouldn't Play
Do you believe in fate or chances
Design or coincidences
Would you say that all the people
Live their life for good and evil
Some have reached the end of patience
Start to play with God's creation
They know you
Control you
In a game we shouldn't play
Corrupt your heart
And make you part
Of a game we shouldn't play
We run blind
In a game we shouldn't play
Its all a game we shouldn't play
If we shall die now it will happen
If we're good we'll come to heaven
If we shall live it will be so
End your life and you'll see limbo
All is fixed and predetermined
Only time will stretch new sins
He loves you
Alarms you
Of a game we shouldn't play
He tells your heart
To stay apart
From a game we shouldn't play
We run blind
In a game we shouldn't play
Its that kind of game we shouldn't play
Manipulations on the genes
Nuclear contaminated seeds
Clone of the clone in the breeder's zone
Its a game
A game we shouldn't play
We run blind
In a game we shouldn't play
Its that kind of game we shouldn't play
Thanks to vaingloryopera for sending track #13 lyrics and track #10 translation.
1. Beyond The Portal (Intro)
2. Mr. Torture
Welcome to the torture chamber
Said the sign above the entrance
Laughing as he takes you by the hand
Looking like a manic savage
Inside you can sense the anguish
Theatre of pain has just begun
Mr. Torture gives pain
With his whips and his chains
He knows just what you crave
Mr. Torture
If you're feeling alone
Then just pick up your phone
Dial one-eight-double-O
Mr. Torture
Mr. Torture sells pain
Only sixty cents a minute
For his special brand of sinning
Phone guaranteed to blow your mind
You can catch him on his website
Has a live chat every weeknight
Cyber-torture soon coming your way
Mr. Torture sells pain
To the housewives in Spain
He knows just what they crave
Mr. Torture
If you're feeling alone
Then just pick up your phone
Dial one-eight-double-O
Mr. Torture
Mr. Torture sells pain
Handcuffed, bound, chained, and blinded
Body, soul, and mind ignited
Every sense is torn and ripped apart
He's been banned in twenty countries
Though he does it for money
He gets pleasure from hearing you scream
Mr. Torture gives pain
With his whips and his chains
He knows just what you crave
Mr. Torture
If you're feeling alone
Then just pick up your phone
Dial one-eight-double-O
Mr. Torture
Mr. Torture
Mr. Torture sells pain...
3. All Over The Nations
I keep wondering all these days
How to thrive the way we stray
A year, a lifetime—parted, together
Will be all the same
Many things do make me sad
Some can even drive me mad
Just fear forever
No more endeavours
Leave me where I stand
You are here
And make me feel so high
Day by day
Something one can't deny
Let's give each other certainty
All over the nations the tunes come alive
Winners and losers, we're all alike
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery
We all fade into one
Don't you feel too hypnotized
Or keep your future jeopardized
So what's accomplished crying for nothing?
Skip depression now
Come, arise and take me higher
No more lies, and every soul can see
We're incarnate sincerity
All over the nations the tunes come alive
Winners and losers, we're all alike
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery
We all fade into one
All over the nations the tunes come alive
Winners and losers, we're all alike
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery
We all fade into one
4. Escalation 666
Black you stripped me
Reveal me the secrets of your pain - painful lies?
Life itself that feeds your wisdom
Almost everyday you put yourself high on a shelf
Whatever you do, wherever you go
Never turn my back on you
Shadows on the wall
Darkness is spreading
I warm my hands on the flames of lies
In vain I scream against the wind
They don't understand my last testament
Escalation 666
Escalation 666
Escalation 666
Deceit and malice
Every smile hides betrayal and greed, hypocrisy
We've been like brothers
Now I hold out my hands to a bloodless, to a bloodless soul
Shadows on the wall
Darkness is spreading
I warm my hands on the flames of lies
In vain I scream against the wind
They don't understand my last testament
Shadows on the wall
Darkness is spreading
I warm my hands on the flames of lies
In vain I scream against the wind
They don't understand my last testament
Escalation 666
Escalation 666 (my last testament)
Escalation 666 (my last testament)
5. Mirror Mirror
My age you keep uncertain
This spell cannot be broken
Visions of eternal youth
We share one face together
Associates forever
Only you know the truth
Mirror mirror on the wall
Whose the master of them all?
Mirror Mirror split in two
Look at me, who are you?
I swim in my reflection
Mirror answer my question
Tell me what I want to hear
I see a perfect creature
Contracted human feature
I'll drown you with your vanity
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Whose the sickest of them all
Mirror Mirror split in two
Look at me - who are you?
No, my life is beautiful
I said, my life is beautiful
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Whose the sickest one of all
Mirror mirror split in two
Look at me - Who are you
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Whose the master of them all
Mirror Mirror split in two
Look at me - who are you?
6. If I Could Fly
No fear, no pain
Nobody left to blame
I'll try alone
Make destiny my own
I learn to free my mind
Myself I now must find
Once more
Once more
If I could fly
Like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the heavens I sail
If I could fly
So here I am
In solitude I stand
I've got dreams inside
I need to realize
My faith has grown
No fear of the unknown
No more
No more
If I could fly
Like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
I could ravage my jail
If I could fly
7. Salvation
Sent to a world cold as steel
Don't know where else I have been
Where will I go? - I can't tell
Who would save us if we fell
Can you feel what I see?
In blind faith would you believe?
Don't share my point of view
But it may mean a lot to you
Tell me will we remember
How it used to be?
Will it be the same
In a time in the future?
Will there be a different way
Can one ever say?
Anthem for a distant world
We'll all be alike
Be there 'til eternity
One will see
When salvation comes our way
All my life I was sure
Kept my thoughts clean, real and pure
Just as I will always know
Were down here to learn and grow
I am my own entity
And the world is there for free
Keeps me alive 'til that day
When my soul will find the way
In another dimension
You may find paradise
We'll be safe and warm
I've been told there will be everyone
I held so close and near
There will be no fear
Anthem for a distant world
We'll be all alike
Be there 'til eternity
One will see
When salvation comes our way
Anthem for a distant world
We'll be all alike
Be there 'til eternity
One will see
When salvation comes
When salvation comes
When salvation comes our way
8. The Departed Sun Is Going Down
There I stood with the sun in my eyes
Dust on my face
And mouth parched and dry
Memories are racing
Flashing scenes through my mind
I know what's ahead
Today would be a good day to die
Once I thought I had a golden heart
Once I thought my dreams would never shatter
Now I stand here
Jaded and cold
Epitaph being carved on my tombstone
I would die for you - would you die with me?
No, you can't deny
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?
Blaze across the sky
Sun is going down
And there's no tomorrow
Sun is going down
Going down on me
Sun is going down
No more time to borrow
Dance with the devil
Sun is going down
For the lonely hearted
Sun is going down
In a blink of an eye
Sun is going down
On the departed
Laugh at the devil
I would die for you - would you die with me?
Caught in a fight
I was drawn again
I never thought I'd be betrayed
By my best friend
He lost his life as he went for mine
If this is the end
I want to die with you
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?
Blaze across the sky
Sun is going down
Going down on me
Sun is going down
No more time to borrow
Dance with the devil
Sun is going down
For the lonely hearted
Sun is going down
In a blink of an eye
Sun is going down
On the departed
Laugh at the devil
I would die for you - would you die with me?
No, you can't deny
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?
Blaze across the sky
Sun is going down
Going down on me
Sun is going down
No more time to borrow
Dance with the devil
Sun is going down
For the lonely hearted
Sun is going down
In a blink of an eye
Sun is going down
On the departed
Laugh at the devil
Sun is going down
No more time to borrow
Sun is going down
Sun is going down
Sun is going down
...
I would die for you - would you die with me?
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?
9. I Live For Your Pain
Unchain your obscenity
Desirable enemy
Await my enlightening
Allow what your fate can bring
Now you're caught inside my cage
You are the object of my rage
Sin, I wash you clean again
I'm your redeemer
Cause I
I live for your pain
I live for your pain
I'm dying
My victim you are meant to be
No, you cannot hide nor flee
You know what I'm looking for
Pleasure your torture, I will endure
Now you are rust inside my cage
you are the object of my rage
Blood, I wash you clean again
I'm your redeemer
Cause I
I live for your pain
I live for your pain
I'm dying
I'll burn in your flame
I live for your pain
I'm dying
I'm dying
I'll burn
Now you are rust inside my cage
You - the object of my rage
Blood I wash you clean again
I'm your redeemer
Be my believer
Cause I,
I live for your pain
I live for your pain
I'm dying
I'll burn in your flame
I live for your pain
I'm dying
I'm dying
I'm dying
I'll burn
10. We Damn The Night
Blood in my pillow
Blood in my skin
Am I going mad
Or was this a dream?
There in the depth
The hollow souls wait
Voices surround me
Tempting my fate
Then out of nowhere
Figures in white
Guarding my soul in the fight
We are strong we re'alive
We have faith in his might
We believe in the everlasting light
Anytime, anywhere we will always be there
We will fight for what's just and what's right
We damn the night
Out in the blackness
Shivering cold
Doubt takes on shape
Fear the unknown
Eyes of the fallen
Piercing their glance
Whispers of doom
Left without chance
Then out of nowhere
Figures in white
Shield my soul in the fight
We're strong, we're alive
We have faith in his might
We believe in the everlasting light
Anytime, anywhere we will always be there
We will fight for what's just and what's right
We damn the night
We're strong, we're alive
We have faith in his might
We believe in the everlasting light
Anytime, anywhere we will always be there
We will fight for what's just and what's right
We damn the night
We damn the night
We damn the night
11. Immortal
Two lives, one fate
I have to leave
So will you follow me?
That's how it's meant to be
I reigned as God
I'm monumental
Soon I will arise
With you by my side
And we will radiate the skies
He who will gaze our lights
Will kill his mind, his vision blind
Tonight we are stars
Stars that shine on bright
Tonight we are stars
Stars immortal light
Tonight we are stars
All treasures all goods
We bury where we lay down to die
And pay for paradise
Await the highest thorn of all
And who will gaze our lights
Will kill his mind, is going blind
Tonight we are stars
Stars that shine on bright
Tonight we are stars
Stars inside the nights of ache
Love and hate
Hope and shade
Take you away
I will take you away
I'm gonna take you away
I'm gonna take you away
Tonight we are stars
Stars that shine on bright
Tonight we are stars
Stars immortal light of ache
Light of hate
Hope and shade
Part of the fate
Tonight we are stars
12. The Dark Ride
All board step right this way
The dark ride is leaving soon
Just sign your name on the dotted line
All I want is just your soul
Tighten your belt and lets go
Standing in line to get to the fairground
Heading to the wicked side
One way ticket, there is no returning
Leave your soul at the gates
Out of doubt, no hope
Satan feeds our madness
Insanity confirms where we stand
Spit the red vile breath and
Wrath is our gift that
Leads direct to Armageddon
Take a place - on the dark ride
Slowly creeping up - quickly coming down
Take a spin on the dark ride
May too far from the other side
Step inside and take this final journey
Your fantasies will come true
Inclination without liberation
Life's carousel is catching you
Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Driven to our final fate
Jump out of this game
Can we ever stop this ride to hell?
Take a place - on the dark ride
Slowly creeping up - quickly coming down
Take a spin on the dark ride
May too far from the other side
Is there any wonder?
Why we came about
Was it for love?
Or to let sin abound
Isn't it a wonder
Awake from blood thick dreams
Remove all the stones from our hearts
We must all believe
Oh, will we find a way to the other side
Heading for a light
Who is holding the key, why can't we see
The dark ride
I force the engine of your deadly sins
Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
I'm your pain when you can't feel
I know too well you'll follow me, you follow me down
Is there any wonder?
Why we came about
Was it for love?
Or to let sin abound
Isn't it a wonder
Awake from blood thick dreams
Remove all the stones from our hearts
We must all believe
13. The Madness Of The Crowds
Sightless the one who relays on promise
Blind he who follows the path of vows
Deaf he who tolerates words of deception
But they who fathom the truth bellow
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane
The madness of the game
Guilty the one with his silent knowledge
Exploiting innocence for himself
Dangerous he whom our faith was given
Broad is the road leading straight to hell
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane
The madness of the game
Dangerous he whom our faith was given
Broad is the road leading straight to hell
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane
The madness of the game
14. Deliver Us From Temptation
A priest caught in lust
Is roaming the red light
Pays to indulge his sins
Body cry
Each day he awakes
And prays for forgiveness
"Our Father", he cries to his God
"Set me free"
Once we may ask for forgiveness
Someday we could see paradise
His words echo to his disciples
Yet again he'll give in to his vice
Caught and bound by temptation
So ashamed of running free
Sweet embrace, captivation
Carnal truth against out beliefs
Deliver us
Deliver us
His suit hides the truth
His business is pushing
Supplying the kings of the street
Rich man's pride
Higher than high, a kid passing by
Blows off his head and escapes
Outta sight - outta sight
Who finds the road to redemption
The preacher, the kid, or the man
Who will decide it, I wonder
Vicious circle entangled and trapped
Caught and bound by temptation
So ashamed of running free
Sweet embrace, captivation
Carnal truth against our beliefs
Deliver us
Deliver us
Once we may ask for forgiveness
Someday we could see paradise
His words echo to his disciples
Yet again he'll give in to his vice
Caught and bound by temptation
So ashamed of running free
Sweet embrace, captivation
Carnal truth against our beliefs
Deliver us
Deliver us
Deliver us
Deliver us
1. Just A Little Sign
Here I stand alone again
Hundreds all around (hundreds all around)
Didn't come here to make a friend
But to listen to the sound (listen to the sound)
Something's growing in my pants
As she looks into my eyes
Now I smile the whole damn night
But my dream acts cold as ice
It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
Just a little sign
Shouldn't I dare to talk to her
But what is it I would say (is it I would say)
Surely I'd look like a clown
For my smiles freeze on my face
It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
Just a little sign
It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
Just a little sign
Just a little sign
2. Open Your Life
Do you know what there is just behind your wall
Do you hate what you can't see on the spinning ball
Ignorant and wasted that's what you are
But you could be so much more
Listen to your TV, believe the words
And you're dumber than before
Try to see the real picture
To train your mind to read between the lines
Take your level higher that is your way
Just get up, start out today
Time seems an endless road when we are young
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Full synthetic anger that's what you breathe
It's a strategy for all
Telling people stories and bed time tales
But the real important false
So you grow the wrong seed inside your head
To the will of the modern priest
Supervised aggression instructed to sleep
That's the devil let you breed
All that we learn is just one point of view
Out there in the world it may not become true
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Time seems an endless road when we are young
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
3. The Tune
Sometimes there's no tomorrow
Sometimes you hate the day
You feel there may be something
That intends to screw with fate
Take a look at what surround you
Each time you watch the news
Your mind gets set by someone's will
A template you can't choose
Love and desire, dry ice or fire
Don't you just want to flee their magic spell
No mercy for the nations two people are at war
Beliefs divide the dream they share of peace and harmony
Their eyes look up to heaven, address our god in prayers
Their souls exposed, they may decease by emperor's decree
Look, how they're crying
There's no denying
Now change the channel you're remote control
And the tune goes on eternally
For those who share the fear
On a frequency for you and me
You stare but you can't see
You hear and you agree
We're all here for a reason
So we can't just hang around
There's so much left to see and learn
Make way for common ground
And those who head the wrong way
Will rate as minor class
As castaways they'll render fools
When the horsemen come to rule
Strike the last hour in their glass towers
Infinite lust has made the curtain fall
And the tune goes on eternally
For those who share the fear
On a frequency for you and me
You stare but you can't see
You hear but you agree
You agree
And the tune goes on eternally
For those who share the fear
On a frequency for you and me
You stare but you can't see
You hear but you agree
And the tune goes on eternally
For those who long to hear
And those freaks sense they're superior
We're hypnotised, you see
They wave and we agree
4. Never Be A Star
No matter how big we are
We dream of home
The place where we all belong
Therefore this song
We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star
No time to see all our friends
There where we are
Ten thousand miles are quite long
And much too far
We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star (a star) - no
We are who we are
We are who we are
We are who we are
We are who we are
We are who we are
Never be a star
We are who we are
Never be a star
We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star, never be (a star)
We are who we are
We'll never be a star (never be a star)
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star (never be a star)
We are who we are
We'll never be a star (never be a star)
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star, never be
We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star
We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star (never be a star)
5. Liar
As a dancer she's undercover
Won the Big Don to be her lover
Had to make him tell her his secrets
About his buiseness and about his street-rats
She had to become his trustful right hand
The burean needed the files with his brand
She really was a damn good actress
Everybody called her 'Big Don's Mistress'
Oh, it's just a show
Put on for love
How could he know
Liar, liar
Sweet desire
Liar, liar
Who are you
She sent the messages thru her office
The Don reckoned he will face a judas
So he told her of a damned deceiver
Secured, in her he was a strong believer
He confessed to her being sick of all this
How he suffered in the deepest abyss
But saw in her the wish for a new life
To escape from there and make her his wife
No, not just a show
Put on for love
How could he know
Liar, liar
Sweet desire
Liar, liar
Who are you
Liar, liar
Play with fire
Liar, liar
Learn the truth
It had turned somehow
She had not seen how
Felt the bullet still flying
Straight went into her heart
Tore her old world apart
Now to live on she first had to die
There's a reason to live
There's a reason to live and let die
There's a reason to give
There's a reason to give in a lie
Liar, liar
Sweet desire
Liar, liar
Learn the truth
Liar, liar
Sweet desire
Liar, liar
Who are you
Liar, liar
Play with fire
Liar, liar
You learned your truth now
6. Sun 4 The World
Forty million years ago
There was a boy called Leif
His skin was grey, his eyes were red
The tentacles counted five
Grown up in a normal house
His parents beloved son
There never was the slightest sign
He'd be the chosen one
Leif (No!)
Help us (No!)
Shelter us
He turns into the Sun for the world
Sun for the world
What would I say (what would I say)
Would it be me, my friend
Down on earth we see a star
Dying in it's light
Then suddenly it all explodes
A new sun shines with Leif
Leif (No!)
Help us (No!)
Shelter us
He turns into the Sun for the world
Sun for the world
What would I say (what would I say)
Would it be me
Sun for the world
Sun for the world
What would you do (what would you do)
Would it be you, my friend
Leif
Help us
Shelter us
He turns into the Sun for the world
Sun for the world
What would I say (what would I say)
Would it be me
Sun for the world
Sun for the world
What would you do (what would you do)
Would it be you, my friend
7. Don't Stop Being Crazy
You're the one I would pick out in a million
You're the one I would wish for as the friend of my life (life)
If the whole world decided for a colour
Would pixels be any different in you (you)
Brave and smart against the rules
You smile upon the fools
I'll follow where you go
I want you to know
Don't stop being crazy
Wherever you go
Don't stop being crazy
It's a lie
It's a lie
It's a lie we could not learn to fly
Oh no
Don't stop being crazy
When you walk you walk higher than the others
When you talk you talk merciless the bothering truth (truth)
Everyone seems remote-controlled nowadays
Only you have a frequency far beyond their ways (ways)
Still that strong you walk alone
Don't wonder where they're gone
I'll follow where you go
I want you to know
Don't stop being crazy
Wherever you go
Don't stop being crazy
It's a lie
It's a lie
It's a lie we could not learn to fly
Oh no
Don't stop being crazy (crazy)
Still that strong you walk alone
Don't wonder where they're gone
I'll follow where you go
I want you to know
Don't stop being crazy
Wherever you go
Don't stop being crazy
It's a lie
It's a lie
It's a lie we could not learn to fly
Oh no
Don't stop being crazy
8. Do You Feel Good?
When we were lovers you called me names
But time goes on and you were gone
I got told you you're a big shot for the ties
And take it from behind
Now you took a new flat in a different town
And rumors are you're wealthy now
For that high class dress shows you earn well
Where strangers come and go
Do you feel good, do you feel fine
Did you achieve what you had in mind
Do you live cool, not too confined
What can you tell this old heart of mine
Some busty companion claims to know you well
Does night shift at some place somewhere
Said there's no one who has fun your way
In Moscow, Rome, LA
I wish I knew...
Where you are now
Your number's dead and you never call
Do you feel good, do you feel fine
Did you achieve what you had in mind
Do you live cool, not too confined
What can you tell this old heart of mine
Well I got no objections
I'm old enough, you know
But it's weird this night I seem to know you
Better than before
Do you feel good, do you feel fine
Did you achieve what you had in mind
Do you live cool, not too confined
What can you tell this old heart of mine
9. Hell Was Made In Heaven
There was a time eating your mind
Eating your heart and your soul
Down to the bone always alone
Nobody waiting at home
Now allow that we unite our fires
Shout it out
Give yourself to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hell was made in heaven
I was made for you
Hell was made in heaven
Made for loving you in sin
Ten years ago you made the vow
Promised your life and your love
Before you have paid, nothing returned
What is enough is enough
Now allow that we unite our fires
Shout it out
Give yourself to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hell was made in heaven
I was made for you
Hell was made in heaven
Made for loving you in sin
Now allow that we unite our fires
Shout it out
Give yourself to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hell was made in heaven
I was made for you
Hell was made in heaven
Made for loving you in sin, in sin
In sin, in sin
10. Back Against The Wall
Can you see now where I stand, my friend
Will you offer me your helping hand
And will you cross the void and speak your little words
Rush, I'm beggin' you, it hurts
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts
I'm standing back against the wall
Dare I to move I got to fall
My heart is blinded by the light
I close my eyes forever
May not turn left, may not turn right
I sense a gap to every side
I'm standing back against the wall
Back against the wall
Get back!
Get back!
I can hear it coming closer now
Blaring silence of the dark below
Under my feet I feel it slide like sand
A frequent crushing down again, again, again and again
I'm standing back against the wall
Dare I to move I got to fall
My heart is blinded by the light
I close my eyes forever
May not turn left, may not turn right
I sense a gap to every side
I'm standing back against the wall
Back against the wall
Will you cross the void of pride
Then speak the words
Rush, I'm beggin' you, it hurts
It hurts, it hurts, yes it hurts
I'm standing back against the wall
Dare I to move I got to fall
My heart is blinded by the light
I close my eyes forever
May not turn left, may not turn right
I sense a gap to every side
I'm standing back against the wall
Back against the wall
Get back!
Back against the wall
Get back!
Back against the wall
11. Listen To The Flies
Why do you run - answer me
Who do you follow - talk to me
What is the hidden - that I cannot see
What is the prize - you try to hide from me
I see you dying and I listen (listen)
And I listen (listen)
Listen to the flies
Listen to the flies
Who is the idol you obey
Give me a reason, you're afraid of me
You'd never been punished or never had pride
I see you circle round and round the shite
I see you dying
I see you dying
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
Why do you run - answer me
Who do you follow - talk to me
What is the hidden - that I cannot see
What is the prize - you try to hide from me
I see you dying
I see you dying
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
12. Nothing To Say
When I got told the other day, you said won't it be nice
To spend some time and share a look there was no thinking twice
The die was cast no time to lose as much as one can say
Didn't hesitate to call you back and things were under way
And if it wasn't for the circumstance and well against all odds
Well that's enough for feeling great the best we could have got
And just in case there's something wrong so much with you to share
Much better anyways than watch or stroll round everywhere
Nothing to say
We got it there
A long long way
Right in our hands
Nothing to say
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection
We'll have our way
Like we always do
Nothing to say
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection
We'll have our way
Like we always do
You called me up the other day just when I thought you would
And asked if we could break apart as things ain't been too good
I swallowed hard and got that feel I know it's called unease
The confidence I've kept so well just came down piece by piece
That's all it takes it's sad but done no way to disagree
Time takes toll and that's the way it's always gonna be
Cos it wasn't yet the circumstance but more than just a test
There's little left for feeling great and all I need's some rest
There's not a single glimpse of hope well someone took my place
It's yet another turn for me, i'll be messin' round everywhere
Nothing to say
We got it there
A long long way
Thereof our hands
Nothing to say
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection
I'll make my way
Like I always do
Nothing to say
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection
I'll make my way
Like I always do
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh,oh
Nothing to say
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection
I'll make my way
Like I always do
Nothing to say
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection
I'll make my way
Like I always do
I got
I got nothing to say
I got nothing
Nothing to say
I got way
I see a rainbow rising
Nothing to spilled
Long long way
Nothing to say
13. Far Away
We are gifted to be scared
We need stacks of weapons to survive
Marching for religious reasons
Marching on and on to save our lives
When will it have an end
How can we live in harmony
How can I understand the way things gonna be
Take me far away and set my spirit higher
Take me far away and set my soul on fire
And I pretend to understand
Whatever comes I'll be there for you
Genetically influenced
Is our harvest how far can we go
Someday my own clone will come
Take away my wife how could I know
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I could just go insane
But when I see your smile it makes me strong again
Take me far away and set my spirit higher
Take me far away and set my soul on fire
And I pretend to understand
Whatever comes I'll be there for you
14. Fast As A Shark
Fog in the streets
A church clock beats
Midnight - darkness all around
You better beware
You better take care
Be prepared for the shock
The time has come
And he's the one
Who's breathing down your neck
Coming from behind
Now it's your time
A loser will die
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer - he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
Because the killer is on the attack
Surprise attack
Coming from the back
An expert of the deadly knack
Just take care
Just beware
Be prepared for the fight
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer - he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
Because the killer is on the attack
Watch out - watch out
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer - he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
Because the killer is on the attack
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer - he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
Because the killer's
Because the killer's
Because the killer's on the attack

1. King For A 1000 Years
Wouldn't it be nice
To plunder with your eyes
Whatever there's for you to see
Is yours to be
Let me be there
Just tell me you don't care
Just say you pay me afterlife
However high the price
I know your secrets
I know it all
I know your secrets
I see the hidden without light
I am your sickness
Bitting you right behind your eyes
Don't try to kill me
I cannot die, a death you know
You and I will be
Heaven above and hell below
Brother, believe me
Father, conceive me
Perceive me
Time will be a turning wheel
We shove or retard
Time will a toy
Time we will enjoy
Say you want to live forever
Minus one day
Say you will obey and I
I will show - I will show
I will show your Reich of gold
And I will show - I will show
I will show you friend and foe
Wouldn't it be nice
To reign and to decide
Whatever there's attracting you
Will give its due to you
Let me be there
Just say you want to share
A power no one will withstand
Just be my human hand
I know your secrets
You want it all
I will show - I will show
I will show you Reich of gold
And I will show - I will show
I will show you friend and foe
Alienation, elimination, chaos, no exoneration
No believers, all deceivers, no illusion, executions
We are King For A 1000 Years
We are king of a million tears
We're the ones who bring desire
Binding their greed and fears
We are king of fallen men
We are keepers of the damned
Turning hope into obsession
We are the king
We are The King For A 1000 Years
Ages of fire - Aeon of darkness, fear and hate
Wake up my creatures
Stand up you bringers of man's fate
No one can kill us
We cannot die, a death one knows
Mankind is sleeping
My victory near, their end so close
I know their secrets
I know it all
Goodbye sorrows
Borrow me your hand to turn the key
Release me - Believe me
Goddbye sorrows
Never more you have to fear futurity
Goodbye sorrows
Borrow me your hand to turn the key
Conceive me
Time will be a turning wheel
We shove or retard
Time will a toy
Time we will enjoy
Say you want to live forever
Minus one day
Say you will obey and I
I will show - I will show
I will show your Reich of gold
And I will show - I will show
I will show you friend and foe
We are King For A 1000 Years
We are king of a million tears
We're the ones who bring desire
Binding their greed and fears
We are king of fallen men
We are keepers of the damned
Turning hope into obsession
We are the king
We are The King For A 1000 Years
2. The Invisible Man
I am the one who wants to show
You a secret of your cheating world
Wherever I will go - No one can see me
'Cause I'm the invisible man
I'm a creature with one goal
Rise up to heaven when the time has come
I have no body but a soul
Gods law is written on my way, forever
Time by time I think it's over
The malediction I have got
When the world was young
I've been captured in the name of god
To save people, but who cares?
Since a thousand years
Until the holy land will come
Here I am the invisible man
A lost fallen angel helping mankind where I can
My memories are there to save your world
For you I'm just the invisible man
There's the destiny you don't know
I'm a guardian angel and whatever you'll go
You fight through your life not alone
You can't hear me, nor see me
But trust the holy flow
Here I am the invisible man
A lost fallen angel helping mankind where I can
My memories are there to save your world
For you I'm just the invisible man
3. Born On Judgment Day
My mother died close to me
And while I lie sobbin' here
This world's going down with fear
Armies of minions is all I see
Creatures in anguish no place to flee
Living their nightmares the fall from grace
And so I'm standing here
I was born on judgment day
And I have no words to say
Don't know good or bad
Kinda feel so sad
But still, I sing this song for you
There's no one beside me
I'm shuddering wearily
Utterly destitute and all
Nobility has let mankind
Turned into vultures, bewildered eyes
Shoved to the abyss, a twisting whirl
Under the blood red sky
I was born on judgment day
And I have no words to say
Don't know good or bad
Kinda feel so sad
But still, I sing this song for you
I was born on judgment day
And I have no words to say
Don't know good or bad
Kinda feel so sad
But still, I sing this song for you
4. Pleasure Drone
There's an abyss in your life
'Cause a good love's gone bad
You've lost someone for now and forever
She was the best you've ever had
Just let me go it's a hopeless endeavor
Don't stick your head in the sand
Don't you cry so much, it doesn't help
Not with her picture in your hand
Just when you lose your smiling face
Gonna bring you to a special place, 'cause I'm a
Drone, pleasure drone
And I wipe your tears away
Drone, pleasure drone
I'm gonna make you a perfect day
I'm made for sensing your mood
No reason for despair
Can you hear mechanical noises
When I buzz thru the air
To get you up I'll hand you presents
From my telescopic arm
No matter they're no hands
But my claws won't do no harm
And wherever there's bad vibes
I will detect them with laser eyes, cause I'm a
Drone, pleasure drone
And I wipe your tears away
Drone, pleasure drone
I'm gonna make you a perfect day
Drone, pleasure drone
And I wipe your tears away
Drone, pleasure drone
I'm gonna make you a perfect day
Drone, pleasure drone
5. Mrs. God
Mrs. God, am I right?
That's your real address?
This time it's you
Ready to confess?
Free the masculine world
Cancel their humility
Mrs. God, can it be?
Can you be alike
One dressed to kill?
Walk on, high-heeled bride
This would state and explain
Why men are sometimes stumbling
Mrs. God are you there
Laughing at us is not fair
Mrs. God can't you see
All that shit you've done to me (and us)
Mrs. God, may I say
As wild card of my kind
We were so deceived (yeah)
You'd better left us blind
Mrs. God we are cool
We take it with a smile
But don't be cruel
Let's add it to the file
And in some 100 years
God has always had beard
Mrs. God are you there
Laughing at us is not fair
Mrs. God can't you see
All that shit you've done to me (and us)
6. Silent Rain
He is God and he is light
He means everything in life
To her awaking mind
He's the one of two she loves
He's the one of two she snogs and hugs
In blind faith
But in the recent dead of nights
There was wonder, there was fright
Daddy's coming for a secret playing
Secret playing
Silent giants
Silent rain
Silence cover shame
Lying colours
Lurking bane
Under the silent rain
Daddy told her not to speak
Not to wail and not to weep
A promise she won't keep
Saw her mother at the door
Starting craven to the core
She won't care no more
So in the endless coming years
There was sorrow, there was fears
Daddy's coming for a secret playing
Secret playing
Silent giants
Silent rain
Silence cover shame
Lying colours
Lurking bane
Under the silent rain
7. Occasion Avenue
What you sight you have seen
Where you go already been
The again you go through
Occasion Avenue
Sister, the day you sell your skin
(The gold of night is the gold of the blind)
Sister, that day your soul gives in
(You'll never find what you left behind)
Oh, oh, no matter what they do
Oh, oh, you got to go straight through
Occasion Avenue
Brother, dare not look left or right
(Coaxing your eyes, poisoning your mind)
Brother, don't stop or you must fight
(No indulgence or its death you find)
Oh, oh, you may not leave with doubt
Oh, oh, you may no take it to
Occasion Avenue
Follow your heart - Follow your truth
Follow the path that shines for you
On Occasion Avenue
How far you go - How good you do
Uncovers the prize or rebears you
To Occasion Avenue
Domini, domini - Occasion Avenue - Domini Sancti
Satani, satani - Occasion Avenue - Satani mundi
Will there be tomorrow - Will there be the stars
Will there be a future - time beats in our hearts
Or will there be the fire - branding us his mark
I pray for all us people
Trying to solve the riddle
I don't know where we're going
I don't know if we're being true
On Occasion Avenue
Precious is your tasking
For a little bit of faking
For a tiny slight deception
For some insincere affection
(TV: ...sentenced to 16 years for
Marriage imposture and order
Of murder to his current wife whose
Life assurance's worth one million pounds.)
Much will be your power
By the essence of a flower
By seducement and cold rapture
By abusing mother nature
(TV: ...murdered close to
Old Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie.
Police assumes just one more execution
By competing drug-cartels).
Great will be your status
When you know how to lick anus
When you lie and swindle ruthless
And your biggest hero's Judas
(TV: ...commited suicide in his
New York Penthouse.
He leaves no dependant
So stay tuned for the latest news of
"where do all the millions go").
Will there be tomorrow - Will there be the stars
Will there be a future - Time beats in our hearts
Will there still be laughter - Will there be relief
Will there be religion - Will there be belief
Will you see your people - From your former lifes
Will you know them this time - Will you win the prize
Will there be an ending - Will there be a start
Or will there be the fire - Branding you this mark
I pray for all us people - Trying to solve the riddle
I don't know where we're going
I don't know if we're being true - On Occasion Avenue
Mother, I dreamt of my last life
(You'll never find what you left behind)
Mother, I killed you with my knife
(No indulgence or its death you find)
Oh, oh, we got to make it through - Occasion Avenue
Follow your heart - Follow your truth
Follow the path that shines for you
On Occasion Avenue
How far you go - How good you do
Uncovers the prize or rebears you
To Occasion Avenue
Domini, domini - Occasion Avenue - Domini Sancti
Satani, satani - Occasion Avenue - Satani mundi
Occasion Avenue
8. Light The Universe
In a house up the hill
Lays a boy, he's sleeping still
And the time's creeping by
Till the world prepares to die
Then again out of dust
Will arise what ended last
And the boy will awake
Give his dream a little brake
And the story now goes on and on and on
As the old has died the new arises
And a child will
Light the Universe
Light the Universe
We got blind, we can't read the signs
Light the Universe
Light the Universe
We don't find what's hidden in our mind
Under sand in sea
Covered with eternity
Beats a heart with no fame
Quietly whispering my name
When my time has run out
I will hear it very loud
Telling tales I once knew
But forgot by losing you
And the story now goes on and on and on
As the old has died the new arises
And a boy will
Light the Universe
Light the Universe
We got blind, we can't read the signs
Light the Universe
Light the Universe
We don't find what's hidden in our mind
9. Do You Know What You're Fighting For
Day by day you work off your claws
The line of fate in them
My not pay your loans
You got to keep goin' and goin' on
Strive day by day
Do you know, uh, do you know, do
Do you know what you're fighting for
The seed is sown
But we don't know the score
They will rule us, this breed of futility
You won't make an escape
'Cause we will still be alive
Disenchantment, alienation
A slog to feed future estranged generations
And, retired, will you get rewarded
Your brave restraint?
Do you know, uh, do you know, do
Do you know what you're fighting for
The seed is sown
But we don't know the score
They will rule us, this breed of futility
You won't make an escape
'Cause we will still be alive
Do you know what you're fighting for
The seed is sown
But we don't know the score
They will rule us, this breed of futility
You won't make an escape
'Cause we will still be alive
Uh, will they need you
Will they pay you
10. Come Alive
It don't get better if you're locked behind your door
It don't get better if you're hiding more and more
It may get better if you fight
It may get better if you'd wear a mask and scream
On Halloween
Come alive - Come alive
Rise and see - Rise and be for me
Come alive - Come alive
From the blue - Make it true for You
Come alive
It don't get better if you're acting fro a while
It don't get better if you drown in self denial
It don't get better without pain
It don't get better if you turn around and flee
To ecstasy
Come alive - Come alive
Rise and see - Rise and be for me
Come alive - Come alive
From the blue - Make it true for You
Come alive
11. The Shade In The Shadow
You're reaching out in the dead of night
Searching for my hand
Your know I'm there in the waste of shadows
I'm your pain and friend
I hear your silent cries
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I know your secret lies
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I ban the light and I leave you blind
If you try your eyes
I am enemy or a trusty fellow
In yuor wailing mind
I hear your silent cries
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I know your secret lies
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I hide behind your shame
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
Crying out loud your name
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
The Shade in the Shadows of you
There I cry for you - In the shadows
As I always do - in the shadows
You may oust me there - in the shadows
But I'm always there - in the shadows
In the shadows
I hear your silent cries
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I know your secret lies
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I hide behind your shame
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
Crying out loud your name
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
The Shade in the Shadows of you
There I cry for you
In the shadows
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
As I always do
In the shadows
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
The Shade in the Shadow of you
12. Get It Up
A little thing you sure will know
Why you came here tonight
And not to those other places
I could imagine there's PCs and DVDs
And TV shows
And sex in cars what else you like
Now right here is the place I got to be
Tomorrow I'll be far away
If you got time and nothing else to do now
Together we can change the world
Let's get it up
Rock's here to stay
With the best years of our lives we paid our share
Yeah, yeah
Now tell me what is in our way
To push this right in the face everyday
We spread it further on the town
Now, what'd ya know we're good
To incite a few more disciples
No time to waste makin' haste we're movin' on
Where we'll suspend another night
Do I see grinning faces all round here?
...and is this due to my words
Come treat me nice, y' know, I wasn't raised here
But I mean everything I say
Let's get it up
Rock's here to stay
With the best years of our lives we paid our share
Yeah, yeah
Now tell me what is in our way
To push this right in the face everyday
13. My Life For On More Day
Listen my teachers
Listen my preachers
Let the world know he broke out
Mankind has failed just to see
What was inevitably
Satan has taken
And hidden painstakin'
One of the seven of fate
Out of the sea he has buried it
Under the mountain of greed
Stone by stone
You must carry off stone by stone
On and on
Until the final blinding light shows it's too late
Too late
There is a chance for everyone
Needs time but can be done
Fight the darkness
Don't be afraid my friends
The last key you have to find
And so will save mankind
Keep on trying when I give away
My life for one more day
My life for one more day
My life for hours you must find the way
My life for one more day
You, who will find it - You, who will bind it
And throw it back into the sea
Will be successor and follower
Of all my unowned might
Reckon with treason
For just one reason
Reckon with envy and hate
Too many people will always believe
In the sermon of night
Stone by stone
You must carry off stone by stone
On and on
Until the final blinding light shows it's too late
Too late
There is a chance for everyone
Needs time but can be done
Fight the darkness
Don't be afraid my friends
The last key you have to find
And so will save mankind
Keep on trying when I give away
My life for one more day
My life for one more day
My life for hours you must find the way
My life for one more day
Now I must leave
Now I must leave
Banish the evil
Trust and believe
Trust that you need
Nothing but love
There is a chance for everyone
Needs time but can be done
Fight the darkness
Don't be afraid my friends
The last key you have to find
And so will save mankind
Keep on trying when I give away
My life for one more day
My life for one more day
My life for hours you must find the way
My life for one more day
14. Run
You think you're awake, the night was long
Don't be afraid, a new day is born
Just open your eyes and look around
You can't see a thing but still hear their sounds
Rememeber if you ask for release
Say the words and you'll be free
Run, run, run
Say the name of your enemy
Run, run, run
Lost and blind for eternity
Remember the words and you'll be free
Toss and turn, your sheets soaked with sweat
The poison of fear already reigns your head
The longer you wait the deeper you fall
Down to the demons you once dared to call
Remember if you ask for release
Say the words and you'll be free
Run, run, run
Say the name of your enemy
Run, run, run
Lost and blind for eternity
Remember the words and you'll be free
INTRO:
Forgotten in his reich from shadows-
Banned forever, one thought-
The Lord of evil was given name and place
Of the seventh sea, shelter of the seventh key
Who was betraying us? I guess you know
There would be more than one name to name
Now he, whose name is many, searches for the one...
The one strong enough to survive as his terrestial hand
enticement and promise will crown a king-
A puppet on a string- for a 1000 years,
...so they sing...
Thanks to emanriquer for sending these lyrics.
1. Crack The Riddle (Intro)
So you want to be rich and you want to win fame
Your face on a poster immortal your name
So you want a good life on the highest top level
Then bet your soul and turn the wheel
It's gambling with the devil
2. Kill It
I'm your maker
Mold your mind
Idea-creator
Bias from behind
People never wonder
How the world goes round
They who care go under
That's what I'm about
I Kill It, Kill It, Kill It
Kill It, Kill It
Care must die
Kill It, Kill It, Kill It
What we can't tie
What we can't buy
Must die
I'm soul hunter
Of the might
Upright hatemonger
Angel of the blind
People never wonder
How the world goes round
They who care go under
That's what I'm about
I Kill It, Kill It, Kill It
Kill It, Kill It
Care must die
Kill It, Kill It, Kill It
People never wonder
How the world goes round
They who know must follow
They who don't die bound
I pay billions
All got a price
Plain corruption
No roll of the dice
People never wonder
How the world goes round
They who care go under
That's what I'm about
I Kill It, Kill It, Kill It
Kill It, Kill It
Care must die
Kill It, Kill It, Kill It
What we can't tie
What we can't buy
Must die
3. The Saints
Gimme gimme sell your souls
I skin and strip you bold(ly)
My revenue ain't yours
All means my way, I'm mighty
I clutch what's mine, yours sevenfold
I leave you in the cold
Got all my schemes in place
You stifle in my maze
All you shysters
Seek shelter on the last day
While you laugh loud, disclaiming
As your dire end will come/dawn on you
Ah you..!
Possessed, in your mask, and a dirty heart
Unrest in ye must've been the devil in all of us
The saints are marching again
And harvest souls
Taking every single one
The saints march again
And harmony
Is here, ye can go testify
Don't you dream you're ever safe
I ll get you in your grave
Go molest your heirs with my
sleight of hand attorneys - I
Profit at your dear expense
Cash in, perform my prance
Relinquish and lose what you
toiled for, anyway
4. As Long As I Fall
I close my eyes so I don't have to see
I shut my heart and tell my mind to run and flee
Once I was flying high
I touched the sky
As long as I fall
I don't hit the ground
As long as I fall
I'm safe and sound
As long as I fly
I sure cannot die
I don't need to hear the call
As long as I fall
Would I have time to change reality
I would become the man
The man I could never be
Oh my God please tell me
How to break free
Once I was flying high
I touched the sky
As long as I fall
I don't hit the ground
As long as I fall
I'm safe and sound
As long as I fly
I sure cannot die
I don't need to hear the call
As long as I fall
As long as I fall
I got no reason to care
As long as I fall
I got no problem to bear
I don't need to bother what I did or did not
I would cry out in pain, but:
As long as I fall
I don't hit the ground
As long as I fall
I'm safe and sound
I don't need to face
No  blame or disgrace
No reason to change at all
As long as I fall
I don't hit the ground
As long as I fall
I'm safe and sound
As long as I fly
I sure cannot die
I don't need to hear the call
As long as I fall
5. Paint A New World
We all know the feeling, it's frightenin' sometimes
When we catch the news on the radio
Death, war,destruction, limitless pain
All the tears that have been cried
Time is running, years gone by
No one to break the silence
What we do is what we get
We harvest what we've sown
Poles are melting, holes in the sky
Woods are on fire
Scary pollution, our world's gonna die
Look what we do
It's madness
I paint a new world
Colours of magic are brightenin'
Paint a new world
Moon sun and stars are risin'
I paint a new world
Magical brushes will lighten
A tame new world
Earthwind, fire and sea
I hear all those voices, I see all the signs
Of killing, rape, forced conformity
Hedonism, decay, deaf dumb and blind
Where do we go from here
Time is running, years gone by
No one to break the silence
What we do is what we get
We harvest what we've sown
Who will wage the next few wars
Wreak havoc on the masses
Politics, religion soaked up with lies
See what we do?
It's madness
I paint a new world
Colours of magic are brightenin'
Paint a new world
Moon sun and stars are risin'
I paint a new world
Magical brushes will lighten
A tame new world
Earthwind, fire and sea
6. Final Fortune
We try to force our final fortune
As if we knew the final score
And we pretend to know things better
In our madness we ignore
How small we are
We are
Far above this ignorance
A higher force you'll find
Forever giving answers to the blind
When fate comes calling you
You don't know what to do
Behind the world we're living in
Is so much more than we do know
There's ONE who loves you so
Behind the world we're living in
There's so much more than we will ever get to know
Protecting nations, wealth and soldiers
Collecting fame and victory
Inventing star-ships, tanks and rockets
But still we don't know how to see
The love in our hearts
Our hearts
Far from all this ignorance
A higher force would share
Verity and hope
But we don't care
When fate comes calling you
You don't know what to do
Behind the world we're living in
Is so much more than we do know
There's ONE who loves you so
Behind the world we're living in
There's so much more than we will ever get to know
7. The Bells Of The 7 Hells
Listen to the whisper of the weak and blind
Listen good if you want to learn how  to survive
Treasure when you've been chosen to turn water into wine
Never meant for your own
Don't drink it!
We are the hive
We are the people
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells
We bear the light
We bear the fire
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells
Shiver, you have taken from the poor in greed
Shiver, you betrayed the ones you've sworn to feed
With given power comes responsibility
When you will regret
Don't take it
We are the hive
We are the people
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells
We bear the light
We bear the fire
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells
Did I keep my vow?
Did I wrong somehow?
Did I stay right on my way?
Have I lied to cover
My precious lover?
My prurience for fame
God help me
God help me
Listen to the breathing of the underground
Listen to the voice that tries to make no sound
Treasure when you've been chosen to turn water into wine
Never meant for your own
Don't drink it!
We are the hive
We are the people
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells
We bear the light
We bear the fire
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells
8. Fallen To Pieces
Thunder
Rain
My aching mind
Arise from a dream
Step aside
Into the shadows
Brightness
Just borrowed
For too short a time
Why must I die one more time if I try?
Way down I pray but the skies turn to grey
How long lived I waiting?
How long can I vie?
I run high and low
I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you
I'm fallen to pieces
Say, do you see you're just playing with me?
Way down I flee from your spell and appeal
No more I'll be  waiting
No longer I'll  vie
I run high and low
I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you
I'm fallen to pieces
Hold on
Hold on
Lies turn to ties for ill famed and disguised
One day you'll pay and  your skies turn to grey
I run high and low
I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you
I'm fallen to pieces
I died times ago
I'm fallen to pieces
Now I rise alone
I'm fallen to pieces
Fallen to pieces
9. I.m.e.
I should not this
I must not that
No matter how I act I must regret
It's not me
It's not me
I got to play
What others say
I got to turn it down when I feel great
That's not me
It's not me
I am me
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to be
I am me
No matter what you say
Today I keep my way
I am me
You make me sick
You make me choke
For me your way of life is just a joke
It's not me
It's not me
I got a face
I got a name
Whatever you perceive is not the same
That I see
It's not me
I am me
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to be
I am me
No matter what you say
Today I keep my way
I am me
I got to change this
To rearrange this
Start writing onto my own pages
It's just me
It's just me
It's just me
I am me
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to be
I am me
No matter what you say
Today I keep my way
I am me
How grave you think you are
To tell me what to be
I am me
You better creep away
Today I'm on my way
I am me
10. Can Do It
When you feel weak
When you feel small
I tell you theres a beast inside you yet unknown
When times get rough
And you're being played
(You) y' ain't gonna flinch or run away cry like a babe
I say that you'd be so surprised seeing what is in for you
If after all you'd still deny it theres nothing I can do
listen up...
come along...
Well you can do it
There's nothing to it
When all others turn their backs on you
There is still yourself to prove it to that
You can do it
There's nothing to it
If the whole damn world abandoned you
You're the only one worth listening to
So, come one come on come on...
come on come on
Get on...
Now look at you
Wearing a crown
Having achieved now all your dreams in just one go
What did I say?
You got it made
Still pondering on the spiteful things of long ago?
No!
I said that you'd be so surprised seeing what is in for you
Now after all that has been done you know what you can do
listen up...
come along...
11. Dreambound
I'm running on a dusty road
The evil one behind me
I hear his breath and turn around
There's no place left to hide here
Wanna break the chains of fear
There's no way back
Your whisper in my ear
Your touch will save me again
You'll change my dream
You'll guide my way to be
You are the light
You turn black into white
You'll change my dream
You'll bring reality
You shine so bright
You turn black into white
I've lost my soul in the game he plays
No doubt that he won't spare me
Hunting me, trapped in his chase
Subject to violation
I'm afraid to fall asleep
Whether day and night
But once I'm there in my dreams
You'll come to save me again
You'll change my dream
You'll guide my way to be
You are the light
You turn black into white
You'll change my dream
You'll bring reality
You shine so bright
You turn black into white
You'll change my dream
You'll steer my way to be
You are the light
You turn black into white
You'll change my dream
You'll bring reality
You are the light
First star I see tonight
12. Heaven Tells No Lies
I could go a step ahead and try
Harder than before but I deny
Always when I try a step
Something's gonna hold me back
Back to where I started
I just bump my head instead
Better leave me here all on my own
Better leave me or become my clone
Everyone who grabbed my  hand
Fell into the same wasteland
Don't try to convince me with your optimistic smile
I'd need a shotgun in my dreams tonight
To terminate my rotten side
Just need one shot into the center of my hate
To light the darkness and run free
From that old spell
I don't know if hell or paradise
Belong together or if Heaven Tells No Lies
You role the dice
You know the price is higher than you can afford
Beware of what you might see
Can you trust your blinded eyes?
I don't know if Heaven Tells No Lies
Black is white and colours turn to grey
What was close is drifting far away
Just now right's  already wrong
What turns weak was never strong
Can I kill the daemon without blowing out my mind?
I'd need a shotgun in my dreams tonight
To terminate my rotten side
Just need one shot into the center of my hate
To light the darkness and run free
From that old spell
I don't know if hell or paradise
Belong together or if Heaven Tells No Lies
You role the dice
You know the price is higher than you can afford
Beware of what you might see
Can you trust your blinded eyes?
I don't know if Heaven Tells No Lies
I will return
You have to burn
Abide my vision, you no longer keep me bound
I will be back
I will attack
In my religion I will make you hell hound drown
13. We Unite
When tyranny will have an end around the world
And freedom has become a part of all our lives
When slavery will have an end to all of us
Then we don't mind the colour of our skin
We go straight for paradise no more treason no more lies
One day we will know what we are fightin' for
Under the eternal sky we unite to be free from your spell
Someday we will know what we are cryin' for
Under the eternal flame that's called freedom again we unite to be free
Dictators and pretenders we don't need no more
No more sending death and soldiers round the world
When no one listens to you and just turns around
Then your worlds'll be blowing in the wind
We go straight for paradise no more treason no more lies
One day I will know under the eternal sky
We unite to be free from your spell
Someday we will know under the eternal flame
That's called freedom again we unite
When tyranny ended and slavery has brought to fall
Then freedom will show that the world we do live in is worth to fight for
One day we will know what we are fightin' for
Under the eternal sky we unite to be free from your spell
One day we will know under the eternal flame
That's called freedom again we unite to be free
14. Find My Freedom
Why you come tonight to take my live?
I know one day it's time to go
Why don't you give me one more chance?
I know that I can try to die another time
Don't wait for me, I'm gonna stay
Because there's much more to get clear
You are always on time
Patiently you wait for me
But you know I'm always too late
Try another day
I don't know where to go
When the time has come for me
Is it heaven or hell?
Well you'll tell me again
Tell I know what to do
In the endless shades of space
Is it heaven or hell?
You will tell me again
To find my freedom
Hey, come on
Go date an other mate
I bade you once ago to go
But now you're back too soon again
You said that I could pay
When all my fear would stay away
Instead my life is high and dry
I'm still afraid to die
You are always on time
Patiently you wait for me
But you know I'm always too late
Come another day
I don't know where to go
When the time has come for me
Is it heaven or hell?
Well you'll tell me again
Tell I know what to do
In the endless shades of space
Is it heaven or hell?
You will tell me again
To find my freedom
Everlasting freedom
15. See The Night
Born into a neighborhood that ain't exactly rich
Never knew his father and his mother was a bitch
Oh no
Didn't have a place to go
Grown up in the streets
He learned to take just what he needs
Violence and crime the only answer he believes
Oh no
Your emotions you don't show
How can you ever give up
When you never were scared?
How can you ever forgive
Without learning to blame?
See the night
That's where you're living
Feel the dark
That seems to follow you
See the stars
I see you crying
See the stars
You wished that one of them just shines for you
After you're gone
Unemployed and full of hate
You're dealing with cocaine
One day you will end up with a needle in your brain
Oh no
As you slowly go insane
How can you ever be good
When you don't see a reason?
How can you trust an old friend
When you don't even care for one?
See the night
That's where you're living
Feel the dark
That seems to follow you
See the stars
I see you crying
See the stars
You wished that one of them just shines for you
After you're gone
All you know is what you see
You see society is treating you bad
No more visions, no more hope
Your future is a cold, cold cell
I send you to hell
Falling so deep into darkness
Crawling so deep in the dark
Give me a chance to regret what I've done
Only if I can explain
See the night
That's where you're living
Feel the dark
That seems to follow you
See the stars
I see you crying
See the stars
You wished that one of them just shines for you
After you're gone

1. Dr. Stein
Once they killed his monster when it went into a trap
Now he's makin' better ones on a higher step
On a warm summer day the doctor went away
To a place where he could make it real
His assistant's hips were nice so he cloned her once or twice
Now his hips are achin' what a deal
Doctor Stein grows funny creatures lets them run into the night
They become great rock musicians and their time is right
Doctor Stein doctor Stein doctor Stein doctor Stein yeah
Sometimes when he's feelin' bored he's callin' it a day
He's got his computers and they do it their own way
They mix some D.N.A. some skin and certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and grey or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Halloween
Doctor Stein grows funny creatures lets them run into the night
They become great politicians and their time is
Doctor Stein right doctor Stein doctor Stein doctor Stein
One night he cloned himself put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind and thought well never mind
Took a syringe and blew out his life
Doctor Stein grows funny creatures lets them run into the night
They become a great obsession and their time is
Doctor Stein grows funny creatures doctor Stein
Doctor Stein grows funny creatures and their time is right
Doctor Stein doctor Stein time is right
Doctor Stein doctor Stein time is right
2. Future World
Ooh ooh ooh ooh if you're out there all alone

3. If I Could Fly
Ooh if I could fly
No fear no pain nobody left to blame
I'll try alone make destiny my own
I learn to free my mind myself I now must find
Once more once more
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall I would picture it all
If I could fly see the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the heavens I sail if I could fly
So here I am in solitude I stand
I've got dreams inside I need to realize
My faith has grown no fear of the unknown
No more no more
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall I would picture it all
If I could fly see the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the heavens I sail if I could fly
If I could if I could fly
If I could if I could fly if I could
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall I would picture it all
If I could fly see the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail I could ravage my jail
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall I would picture it all
If I could fly see the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the heavens I sail if I could fly
4. Where The Rain Grows
I never looked higher mm than I could see
Never gave less than you have given me
The more you have taken you turned into fakes
I finally know now why for heavens' sake
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that if someone's made dumb to the core
He would stay like before
So I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
Now you call me liar 'cause you are just the
Always have right fools majority
Mm I think that if someone starved at your side
You'd all turn your back won't give any dime
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that ii someone's made sad to the core
He would stay like before
So I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that ii someone's made sad to the core
He would stay like before
I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
I take my life I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
5. The Keeper's Trilogy
Masquerade masquerade grab your mask and don't be late
Get out get out well disguised heat and fever in the air tonight
Meet the others at the store knock on other people's door
Trick or treat they have to choice little ghosts are makin' lots a noise
But watch out watch out beware listen listen take care
In the streets on Halloween there's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween the spirits will arise
Make your choice it's hell or paradise
Aah it's Halloween aah it's Halloween oh tonight tonight tonight
I am the one doom's in my hand
Now make your choice redeemed or enslaved
I'll show you passion and glory he is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance he's the corrupter of man
Save me from the evil one give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind's deliverance and peace of mind
Aah it's Halloween aah it's Halloween oh tonight
Make the people hold each other's hands and fill their hearts with truth
You made up your mind so do as divined oh oh
Put on your armour ragged after fights
Hold up your sword you're leaving the light
And make yourself ready for the lords of the dark
They'll watch your way so be cautious quiet and hark
You hear them whispering in the crowns of the trees
You're whirling 'round but your eyes don't agree
Will o the wisps misguiding your path
You can't throw a curse without takin' their wrath
Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
Or all us people forget what we've been
Our only hope's your victory kill that Satan who won't let us be
Our only hope's your victory kill that Satan who won't let us be kill
You're the keeper of the seven keys that lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
You can feel cold sweat runnin' down your neck
And the dwarfs of falseness throw mud at your back
Guided by spells from the old seer's hands
You're suffering pain only steel can stand
Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
The seven seas are far away placed in the valley of dust heat and sway
The seven seas are far away placed in the valley of dust heat and sway
You're the keeper of the seven keys that lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
You're the keeper of the seven keys that lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
Wouldn't it be nice to plunder with your eyes
Whatever there's for you to see is yours to be
Let me be there just tell me you don't care
Just say you pay me after life however high the price
I know your secrets I know it all
I know your secrets I see them hidden without light
I am your sickness biting you right behind your lies
Don't try to kill me I cannot die I guess you know
You and I will be heaven above and hell below brother release me
Father conceive me brother believe me perceive me
Time will be a turnin' wheel we show or retard
Time will be a joy time we will enjoy
Say you want to live forever mindless one day say you will obey
And I I will show I will show I will show your Reich of gold
And I will show I will show I will show you friend and foe
Wouldn't it be nice to reign and to decide
Whatever there's attracting you will give its due to you
Let me be there just say you want to share
A power no one will withstand just be my human hand
I know your secrets I know it all
I will show I will show I will show your Reich of gold
And I will show I will show I will show you friend and foe
Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah
Don't believe us or deceive us no illusions executions
Alienation elimination chaos no exoneration
No believers all deceivers no illusions executions
Alienation elimination chaos no exoneration
No believers all deceivers no illusions executions
We are king for a thousand years we are king of a million tears
We're the ones who bring desire binding their greed and fears
We are king of fallen men we are keepers of the damned
Turning hope into obsession we are the king
We are the king for a thousand years
6. Eagle Fly Free
People are in big confusion they don't like their constitutions
Every day they draw conclusions and they're still prepared for war
Some can say what's ineffective some make up themselves attractive
Build up things they call protective well your life seems quite bizarre
In the sky a mighty eagle doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light it's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free let people see just make it your own way
Leave time behind follow the sign together we'll fly someday
Hey we think so supersonic and we make our bombs atomic
Or the better quite neutronic and the poor don't see a dime
Nowadays the air's polluted ancient people persecuted
That's what mankind contributed to create a better time
Eagle fly free let people see just make it your own way
Leave time behind follow the sign together we'll fly someday
Eagle fly free let people see just make it your own way
Leave time behind follow the sign together we'll fly someday
Oh oh eagle fly free let people see just make it your own way
Leave time behind follow the sign together we'll fly someday
7. Perfect Gentleman

8. Forever And One (Neverland)
What can I do will I be gettin' through
Now that I must try to leave it all behind
Did you see what you have done to me
So hard to justify slowly it's passin' by
Forever and one I will miss you however I kiss you
Yet again way down in neverland
So hard I was tryin' tomorrow I'll still be cryin'
How could you hide your lies
Here I am seein' you once again
My mind's so far away my heart's so close to stay
Too proud to fight I'm walkin' back into night
Will I ever find someone to believe
Forever and one I will miss you however I kiss you
Yet again way down in neverland
So hard I was tryin' tomorrow I'll still be cryin'
How could you hide your lies
Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah
Forever and one I will miss you however I kiss you
Yet again way down in neverland
So hard I was tryin' tomorrow I'll still be cryin'
How could you hide your lies
9. I Want Out
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
From our lives beginning on
Oh we are pushed in little forms
No one asks us how we like to be
In school they teach you what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that they're the ones to see
So they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point you give it up
The only thing that's left to think is this
I want out out out to live my life alone
I want out out out leave me be
I want out out out to do things on my own
I want out out out to live my life and to be free
People tell me a and b they tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushin' me from black to white
They're pushing til there's nothing more to hear
But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
'cause I decide the way things gonna be
I want out out out to live my life alone
I want out out out leave me be
I want out out out to do things on my own
I want out out out to live my life and to be free
There's a million ways to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool
And in the end of it none of us is right
Sometimes we need to be alone ooh ooh out out out
No no no no ooh leave me alone
So they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point you're giving up
The only thing that's left to think is this
I want out out out to live my life alone
I want out out out leave me be
I want out out out to do things on my own
I want out out out to live my life and to be free
10. Fallen To Pieces
I run high and low I'm fallen to pieces
Why must I die one more time if I try
Way down I pray but the skies turn to grey
How long lived I waiting
How long lived I waiting how long can I vie
I run high and low I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you I'm fallen to pieces ooh
Say do you see you're just playing with me
Way down I flee from your spell and appeal
No more I'll be waiting
No more I'll be waiting no longer I'll vie
I run high and low I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you I'm fallen to pieces
How long can I vie
I run high and low I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you I'm fallen to pieces
I died times ago I'm fallen to pieces
Now I rise alone I'm fallen to pieces
Fallen to pieces fallen to pieces
11. A Tale That Wasn't Right
Here I stand all alone
Have my mind turned to stone
Have my heart filled up with ice
To avoid its breakin' twice
Thanks to you my dear old friend
But you can't help this is the end
Of a tale that wasn't right
I will have no sleep tonight
In my heart in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain
It's alright we'll stay friends
Trustin' me in my confidence
And let's just say it's just alright
You won't sleep alone tonight
In my heart in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain oh
In my heart in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain
Thanks to thomaslanders for sending these lyrics.
1. Where The Sinners Go
Can you hear me
Do you know me
I'm a taker
I'm a faker
Oh my God, don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Oh my God show me no way
Mercy, don't struck me a blow
Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
May I argue
Is it all true
You forgive us
What is and was
Oh my God, please look away
Mercy, don't struck me a blow
Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Can you hear it
Or is it just summining in my ears only?
It's talking
Words so true and old
I'm afraid to loose my mind
No, no, don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
2. Are You Metal?
I love it loud, let's push it higher
Until the gain shows just red light
I love it true and played with fire
I enjoy a battle without fight
What I hear I adhere
Have no fear, say sincere
Are you metal
Are you metal
Are you
Are you
Are you metal
Heavy metal
Are you metal
Call me insane, call me hard wired
But it's the only noise I like
Believe in loud and fast and higher
I can tell the sound of wrong or right
What I hear I adhere
Have no fear, say sincere
Are you metal
Are you metal
Are you
Are you
Are you metal
Heavy metal
Are you metal
3. Who Is Mr. Madman?
Sixteen years have passed since he,
one perfect of his kind,
the Casanova of his time,
crowned himself to conquer the land
in craving for lust
Lust, one of the seven deadly sins
Punishment he has suffered
Look at him what did he become,
My mind is burning like fire
And my evil heart stands still
All the time they put me in a wheel chair
And their meds give me the thrill
Hold on, what's going on?
Am I alive or dead, what's reality?
Come on, what's right or wrong ?
Am I stumbling through the streets or is it just a stupid dream?
I'm so lost no
I'm not fine
I'm close to borderline
Because I'm sick yeah
They call me Mr. Madman
I was out
For not long
Three lusty women
Walked me home
When they left, they
Called me Mr. Madman
My head is constantly spinning
And my world is going down
All alone I'm staring through the window
Cause the white men took my crown
Hold on, what's going on ?
Am I alive or dead, what's reality ?
Come on, what's right or wrong ?
Am I talking like E.T. or is it just a stupid dream ?
I'm so lost, no
I'm not fine
I'm close to borderline
Because I'm sick yeah
They call me Mr. Madman
Hey you, listen
I can sing
Those evil white men
Got me in
When they left here
They called me Mr. Madman
I'm done with my tricks
Cause yeah the straightjacket fits
When I'm out, you will get who's Mr. Madman!
I will take my last pill
Gettin' ready for the thrill
When I'm out you will know who's Mr. Madman!
4. Raise The Noise
Since ages now we're caught and occupied
With our basic civil rights denied
They came-to-conquer, took our beloved world
We're left to thrive in sorrow and disgrace
Some never knew what freedom was
Now, there's guards everywhere
Someone come!...
Rise up tomorrow to rectify the injustice being done
Raise the noise bring it on
I'll sing it while you're gone
Forever and ever
On with this for as long
There won't be another song now or whenever
But they're flawed, they crave the sound of our melodies
Though exposed to complex things just faint
This way they're rendered helpless easy prey
To be grabbed and bound safely locked away
Also here's one guy to play the pipe
Summons mean tunes that kill
Stadium like set up and verified
Knock 'em out with your skill
Raise the noise bring it on
I'll sing it while you're gone
Forever and ever
On with this for as long
There won't be another song now or whenever
Raise the noise bring it on
I'll sing it while you're gone
Now and forever
On with this for as long
There won't be another song now or whenever
5. World Of Fantasy
I'm reaching out to find a reason
To find an answer and relief
I see a world so strange and cold
I see a world of rules and thieves
The day you're born you're under pressure
Your life is well prepared my friend
They surely teach you what to think how to behave until the end
All I ever wanted is a little piece of life
In a world where I decide things on my own
All I ever needed is a little piece of hope
And then things are gonna turn the other way
I'm living in a world of fantasy
Reality ain't good enough for me
And all that I can feel is nothing but sobriety
I'm living in a world of fantasy
Reality ain't meant or made for me
All that I see is so unreal
And once you're old enough they teach you
Not to be wishful not to care
About the plan that's been already made for you by other hands
But when you fail there's no one out there
To take your hand to catch your tears
The whole construction we have built leaves no such room for blinding fears
I wonder I wonder if I can handle it all
I wonder I wonder if I can carry the weight of the world
6. Long Live The King
I wait in the cold
It should have been summer
It will start to rain
It's just not fair
But we are insane
We wait for the thunder
We wait for the pain
With open hair
Now the stage is on fire
Now explodes the air
Ohohohohohohoh
Ohohohohohohoh
Long live the king
Long live the king
We shout every line
We bang to the metal
Some call out his name
He makes the sign
Now the stage is on fire
Now explodes the air
Ohohohohohohoh
Ohohohohohohoh
Long live the king
Long live the king
You got to feel the spirit
Got to hear the Les Paul
You got to feel the action
Got to ride the death wall
Giving in it
Giving in it
Giving in it all
Giving in it
Giving in it
Giving in it all
The curtain is down
We scream like one choir
Emotions go wild
I shake my hair
Now the stage is on fire
Now explodes the air
Ohohohohohohoh
Ohohohohohohoh
Long live the king
Long live the king
7. The Smile Of The Sun
No more feel, no more heal
No more light meets my eyes
Is it night, is it day
I'm alone, paralyzed
Everybody is waiting for the one
Everyone will freeze to death alone
The smile of the sun
Was stolen - someone
Has taken away
The heart of all day
The smile of the sun
Is gone and no one
But you drives away
The pain of the grey
Is anybody out there
Somebody help me
Got to breathe, got to move
Got to get back my life
Here's no hope, here's no joy
In this world full of strife
Gone away, gone astray
All I once believed in
It's my soul, it's my heart
It beats slower and dies
Everybody is waiting for the one
Everyone will freeze to death alone
The smile of the sun
Was stolen - someone
Has taken away
The heart of all day
The smile of the sun
Is gone and no one
But you drives away
The pain of the grey
Is anybody out there waiting
Anybody out there for me
The smile of the sun
Was stolen
Somebody help me
The smile of the sun
Is gone and no one
But you drives away
The pain of the grey
The smile of the sun
Was stolen - someone
Has taken away
The heart of all day
The smile of the sun
Is gone and no one
But you drives away
The pain of the grey
Is anybody out there waiting
Anybody out there for me
Is anybody out there searching
Anybody out there, call me
The smile of the sun
Was stolen
Somebody help me
8. You Stupid Mankind
You think you are alone
In this universe
What would you say if there are some
Armed with all you deserve
Destiny my friend you'll see
Counts nothing anymore
Open up your mind now and realize
They may come for sure
Dead and gone
No survivors
They'll hit and crush our earth
You stupid mankind
Evolution everywhere
Who do you think you are
Like you are on the top of there ?
They may come for war
More evil, violent and vain
Than you could ever be
Can beam through time and bring you pain
All dead no one flees
Destiny my friend you'll see
Counts nothing anymore
Open up your mind now and realize
They may come for sure
Dead and gone
No survivors
They'll hit and crush our earth
With no mercy
Dead and gone
No more fighting
They'll kill and burn your earth
You stupid mankind
They don't care
They don't care
They don't care
They don't care
Dead and gone
No survivors
They'll hit and crush our earth
With no mercy
Dead and gone
No more fighting
They'll kill and burn your earth
You stupid mankind
9. If A Mountain Could Talk
We hurt who we love we destroy what we need
For profit we sell our souls
We're sowing disaster, the mess is complete,
Resources will soon be consumed
Open your eyes see the signs all around;
Hoping fate will have mercy on all
Someday the next generation will pay
But one day it' s too late to regret
If a mountain could talk it would tell us a story
To reign in love means just how to say sorry
If an ocean could cry we would drown in it's tears
Dusk breaks to dawn,
Which we cannot survive without love
Time passes by, time's gonna fly
Life is much too short to understand it
Don't even try
Time passes by, time's gonna fly
Don't fill up your heart with hate and anger
Give it a try
I know that things are going wrong sometimes
But then we need to get it right
I feel the pressure's so intense, sometimes,
I know we need a change tonight.
If a mountain could talk it...
Always on time always right on track
Expectations are set to the limit
Is it too late is there no turning back
All I need is a moment in peace
10. The Sage, The Fool, The Sinner
A tramp found dead, in the street, just made the news
Forensics report read 'drug abuse'
Found a warehouse slip in his sleeve
Marine corps major down-at-heel
They got to the place, unlocked the shed
Soon left awestruck, stunned, amazed
Among stuff and things lay pledges and bonds
Up to a few Mil in the end
The sage the fool the sinner
And what goes for you, one can't ever say
The sage the fool the sinner
One can't foretell fate, no way, no way
Sassy lady puts on her fav heels
Mirror checked, all done - snow white appeal
Adjust the dress, ready to leave
Grab some cash, cab's outside, wipe off a tear
On her way out, she turns once more
To wave her man good - bye
While in his sleep, he recalls thirty years - due to end that night.
11. My Sacrifice
Voices, I hear the people calling
Deep in my dreams
Choices, I made my own they've fallen
Apart with their screams
Waiting for my time
Oh Lord, please forgive me
Waiting for a hero,
An angel relieve me
In a land after life,
I'll give my sacrifice
In a world of dignity
There is no need to flee
In a land after time
I'll give my sacrifice
In a world of glory skies
There is no need to die
Chances, I took enough to fight it
All through my life
Advances, I had them all and lost 'em
They're out of my sight
Waiting for my time
Oh Lord, please forgive me
Waiting for a hero,
An angel relieve me
In a land after life,
I'll give my sacrifice
In a world of dignity
There is no need to flee
In a land after time
I'll give my sacrifice
In a world of glory skies
There is no need to die
12. Not Yet Today
Good-bye my friend
You were closer than a brother
Good-bye my friend
Close your eyes, don't be afraid
Life ain't the end
Strive with the wind
And I will follow some day
And I will follow your way
But not yet today
But not yet today
13. Far In The Future
Can you hear - isolated
Can you see - aberrated
Can you sigh, I'm frustrated
Make my day
Can you feel animation
Shall I bring you salvation
No, I hate this temptation
Make my day
Pray, pray
I'm afraid
Afraid
Meet you somewhere
Far in the future
There I will wait for you
Far in the future
We're gonna make it through
I'll wait
Wait
Hear my voice, I don't care what they're saying
Feel my touch, I think you're only sleeping
They say you're like blind
They say you're like dead
Still the day will come, I may stop weeping
I play you heavy metal
Soul, punk, dance to unsettle
One sign please, one reaction
Make my day
Pray, pray
I'm afraid
Afraid
Wake up somewhere far in the future
There I will wait for you
Far in the future
We're gonna make it through
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
One of us is dying
One's left behind
Two of us are crying
One loud and one in mind
When your heart stops beating
I'll go your way
When you yet start speaking
You made my day, day, day
Got to pray, pray, pray
Make my day
Pray, pray
I'm afraid
Afraid
Meet you somewhere far in the future
There I will wait for you
Far in the future
We're gonna make it through
Far in the future
There hides another life
Far in the future
We let it all revive
I'll wait
Wait
Wait
14. I'm Free
I'm free, as free as one can be
In a world that cries for more equality
I'm free, as free as one can be
In this world so full of tears and misery
Today
Faster and faster we run into life, no time for emotions
Higher and higher we raise our limits too fast
Lost with protectors and will to survive, it's an illusion
Colder and colder it gets as we walk down the line
I don't wanna be a part
Of that foolish game
I just try another start
Nothing stays the same
I'm free, as free as one can be
In a world that cries for more equality
I'm free, as free as one can be
In this world so full of tears and misery
Today
Stronger and stronger we march into thy
Don't show no weakness
Don't show no mercy for those who are allied in pain
Stay where you are no complaining at all
Never get restless
Never just step out of line cause it won't be the same
I don't wanna be a part
Of that foolish game
I just try another start
Or else I go insane
I'm free, as free as one can be
In a world that cries for more equality
I'm free, as free as one can be
In this world so full of tears and misery
Today
I'm free, as free as one can be
In a world that cries for more equality
I'm free, as free as one can be
In this world so full of tears and misery
Today
Today
Today
Today
15. Faster We Fall
I have a dream no more such pain from dictators
No more such racists and no hell on earth
No politicians are tellin´ us lies any more
Life without enemies life without war without war
Some people are starving while some of us stay rich
Some pigs are the masters that pull all the strings
Faster we fall if we won´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before
I have a dream no more commanders and soldiers
Life without enemies life without war
No killing weapons no walkin´ on blood any more
Some people are starving while some of us stay rich
Ooh some pigs are the bastards left the poor all as slaves
Faster we fall if we won´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before stronger than ever before
Faster we fall if we won´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before
Faster we fall if we won´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before stronger than ever before
Stronger than ever be stronger than ever be
Stronger than ever before
16. Aiming High
I´m aiming high I wanna reach the sky
I wanna try to spread my wings and fly
No time to wait, no time to hesitate
It´s not too late I´m breakin´ free
I take the stars up to the sky
At least I carry on and try
Aiming high and try to leave
The world of sorrow
Aiming high and live like there is
No tomorrow aiming high
I´m reaching out for peace and liberty
I´m breakin´ out far from reality
I´m comin´ out until my eyes can see
So clearer now until I´m free
I will take the stars up to the sky yeah yeah
At least I carry on and try for you
Aiming high and try to leave
The world of sorrow
Aiming high and live like there is
No tomorrow aiming high
Aiming high and try to leave
The world of sorrow
Aiming high and live like there is
No tomorrow I am aiming high

1. Nabataea
Way back in time was a nation sublime
For they had what it takes to lead a good life
Foemen believed it’s because of some secrets
They brought the fight and it never ended
Hush, don’t cry
Deep in the night come the raiders
Shiver and pray
Petra will fall to the Great
Oh Nabataea
You came so far
Now gone you are
Oh Nabataea
You morning star
Now so afar
Nabataea
People desire and people admire
Some always try to reign with fire
So are the seals, hence the old Nabateans
Have disappeared under the wire
Hush, don’t cry
Deep in the night come the raiders
Shiver and pray
Petra will fall to the Great
Oh Nabataea
You came so far
Now gone you are
Oh Nabataea
You morning star
Now so afar
Nabataea
Petra, you were a shining star
Unique in your time
Petra, 2000 years on we still
Suffer the same crimes
Petra, today we’re trying hard
To reach your paradigm
We say no
To the ultra-extreme
No
To the killers of dreams
No
No!
Children, children have no fear
Soon we all will disappear
Children, children don’t you cry
Make no sound or we will die
Once there was a land midst of the chaos
Floating like an island in old blood
People lived in peace, there was no hunger
Though they had no slaves, believe it or not
Once there was a nation without soldiers
Never brought a war to other lands
They lived without king or queen or ruler
Once there was the first democracy
Oh Nabataea
You came so far
Now gone you are
Oh Nabataea
You morning star
Now so afar
Oh Nabataea
Oh Nabataea
2. World Of War
Warfare - the only solution for your stupid problems
Soldiers - marching out for your revolution
Killing and burning, destroying, overturning
You got the license to hate
All the others are cowards
You believe they got no power
stealing what they own
Making all the money with your big guns
Ripping out their heart for a drop of oil
World of war
We know it all is not the grand solution
World of of peace
Would give us all an enlightened constitution
Task Force - dirty soul of an american institution
Cold War - military build-up made money for your crown
Killing and burning, destroying, overturning
You lead people into fate
Grab your M-16
Like a war machine
Just make it all yourself
Mothers crying over losing their sons
Ripping out their heart for worthless gold
World of war
We know it all is not the grand solution
World of of peace
Would give us all an enlightened constitution
Persecution, dissolution, execution NO!
World of war
We know it all is not the grand solution
World of of peace
Would give us all an enlightened constitution
World of war
We know it all is not the grand solution
3. Live Now!
There’s somebody made for me
Someone I still don’t see
One I will find tonight
Everything will be alright
Live Now!
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!
Don’t say you’re too scared up high
Life needs no wings to fly
Come out into the light
We can reach the height tonight
Live Now!
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!
Get up and start to see now
Give it a try and learn how
To leave behind the wasteland
Have no fear, I’m taking your hand
Live Now!
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!
4. Far From The Stars
Every time I try to take control I‘m getting mad
Things are always different than you want them all to be
I have learned a million times you can just make it bad
Ain’t no way to change these things to what you wanna see
We take control of our whole wide universe
We are pretending we don‘t need no helping hand
We try to take control of all our whole wide world
But we will never understand
Far from the stars
There might be a higher being we may not yet see
Far from the stars
A better life could wait for me
Every time I lose control I learn a little more
We are not the ones to regulate or justify
Every time I see the world turns round I understand
We are not the ones to dominate or modify
We take control of our whole wide universe
We are pretending we don‘t need no helping hand
We try to take control of all our whole wide world
But we will never understand
Far from the stars
There might be a higher being we may not yet see
Far from the stars
A better life could wait for me
Nobody knows where it begins or where it ends
Time only shows we‘re holding nothing in our hands
Wasting our time trying to know the universe
The end of the line is that we can not live without a strong belief
Far from the stars
There might be a higher being we may not yet see
Far from the stars
A better life could wait for me
5. Burning Sun
He shows disdain for all this world
Dreams of spaceships, to raise him high
What's in his head's made of fantasies
Celestial bodies, all kinda stars
In a different time he'd fly, leave his petty life behind
Pass all planets, make his way through our galaxy – and
Gape in awe at the burning sun
A tangled mesh, insane, divine
Near infinite mighty source
Of a day not bound to end
Spends his days on a cloud it seems
Go and nudge him, ask what it's like
He'd smile and turn, as if tantalized
Concealing something, ain't there for real
His illusions make him see his wildest dreams come true
Quite the helmsman, his hands clenched on some steering wheel and
Gape in awe at the burning sun
A tangled mesh, insane, divine
Near infinite mighty source
Of a day not bound to end
Gape in awe at the burning sun
A tangled mesh, insane, divine
Near infinite mighty source
Of a day not bound to end
Gape in awe at the burning sun
A tangled mesh, insane, divine
Near infinite mighty source
Of a day not bound
A day not bound
A day not bound to end
6. Waiting For The Thunder
Sometimes I’m tough and bold
Just sometimes I am frightened
Sometimes I’m dull and cold
But sometimes so enlightened
I made some old mistakes but still did what I wanted
Sometimes the right you turned into wrong
I did it again
I don’t give a damn
Here I am
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the pain
Waiting for the rain you’re bringing
Here I go
Waiting for the thunder
I am not a saint
Put on your war paint
And kill me
Sometimes I have to leave
Knowing sometimes I got stranded
Sometimes I want to fight
Though many times I was branded
Whatever life may bring I just try to keep my head up
Sometimes you have no choice but to kill
A man as I am
I don’t give a damn
Here I am
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the fate
I am not afraid to face you
Here I go
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the flame
Play your lousy game and kill me
And kill me
And kill me
Come and kill me
Come and kill me right now
Here I am
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the pain
Waiting for the rain you’re bringing
Here I go
Waiting for the thunder
I am not a a saint
Put on your war paint
And kill me
Here I am
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the fate
I am not afraid to face you
Here I go
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the flame
Play your lousy game and kill me
7. Hold Me In Your Arms
I need your guarding hand to guide
Me through this sand of time
Then I know, I'll be alright
Like a child that never cries
I'm aware of all your rules
But you know that I will run
No matter where I'll follow you
Don't make me go
Take me, take me
Hold me in your arms
Save me, save me
All I need is your love
Maybe you will leave the light on
While I walk into your dream
I can't remember where you came from
(See) the breadcrumbs in the snow
I'm aware of all your rules
But you know that I will run
No matter where I'll follow you
Don't make me go
Take me, take me
Hold me in your arms
Save me, save me
All I need is your love
Take me, take me
Hold me in your arms
Save me, save me
All I need is your love
Take me, take me
Hold me in your arms (hold me in your arms)
Save me, save me
All I need is your love (all I need is your love)
Wake me, wake me
Hold me in your arms
Don't break me, don't break me
I just need a place in your heart
Take me, take me (please take me)
Hold me in your arms (hold me in your arms)
Save me, save me
All I need is your love
I need your guarding hand, my bride
'Til the end of my whole life
8. Wanna Be God
He's a man looking down on the people
He's a prick you got to really call evil
Cannot be stopped, you cannot change his mind
Shots have been lethal
What he eyes is just there for the taking
What he takes will soon be forsaken
He is rich so he'll never die
If money can buy
He says
I don't wanna be an angel
I wanna be god
Mine the key to hell and heaven
I wanna be god
He said - I wanna be god
When a man is just out for the power
All his life, every day, every hour
He should be in the psychiatry
Brainsick and sour
It's a ghost living just for the money
It's a cripple with a heart of a mummy
In a game for eternal fame
A contagious fever
He says
I don't wanna be an angel
I wanna be god
Mine the key to hell and heaven
I wanna be god
I am high, mighty and awed
He said
I wanna be god
9. Straight Out Of Hell
Straight out of hell I waste my life not for tomorrow
Straight out of hell I‘m only livin‘ for today
I roll the dice I know that something strange is coming
I‘m cold as ice I always take it as it comes
Ain‘t no eternity, ain‘t no salvation
In this damnation we will burn
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
There‘s no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
I‘m gonna lose it but it feels so well
I‘m straight out of hell
No ace to play I live my life with no protection
The price I pay my act of grace will be denied
This road to hell and I won‘t find no resurrection
Cause I will sell my dirty soul to rock n‘ roll
Ain‘t no eternity, ain‘t no salvation
In this damnation we will burn
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
There‘s no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
I‘m gonna lose it but it feels so well
Straight out of hell
So sad and lonely I go down
No helping hand no soul around
I lost my faith so long ago
A million tears are gonna flow
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
There‘s no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
I‘m gonna lose it but it feels so well
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
There‘s no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
I‘m gonna lose it but it feels so well
I’m straight out of hell
10. Asshole
I, never saw you goin straight
You, lying right into my face
High, my expectations were for faith
You, you’re driving me insane
No one came that far, without abilities
You’re the greatest of them all
You lie you steal you betray you don’t feel
You’re an asshole
Typical human being
You’re a sucker
Sucking out energy
Asshole
Typical human being
You motherfucker
Stupid shit you make me flee
I, I’m sick of your stupid ego
No, you are not the only one
You, your manipulation stops here

You’re the greatest of them all
You lie you steal you betray
You don’t feel
You’re an asshole
Typical human being
You’re a sucker
Sucking out energy
Asshole

11. Years
I see you beg for truth
Here‘s some news I can convey
All your life‘s in your own hands
Flat or steep you define yourself
Take a stance towards life that will keep you strong so you‘re in control
Free your mind and choose from the good things that come your way
See the years passing by
Add your part, fade and die
We‘re all in this scheme to thrive
In a quest to persevere
Don‘t submit to your fears
Even you‘ll see the light
I just heard, you made the call
Untold myths and pains resolved
Time has shown, no time left to tell
Keep your life, you just saved yourself
Build up strength so life can‘t turn awkward, avoid the pigeonholes
Free your mind to choose from the good things that come your way
12. Make Fire Catch The Fly
Never again
I told myself
I’ll play with fire
Never again
I’ll come too close
To this desire
My melted wings have just healed
When my facetted eyes are bound in fascination
Never say never say
Never again
Never again
Alright
It’s my last flight
Must go on and on
Until I die
Tonight
Into the light
Must go on and on
One last sigh
Make fire catch the fly
Never again
But just tonight
I heed the calling
This could be the end
I won’t regret then when I’m falling
My melted wings have just healed
But my little mind is bound in fascination
Never say never say
Never again
Never again
Alright
It’s my last flight
Must go on and on
Till I die
Tonight
Into the light
Must go on and on
One last sigh
Make fire catch the fly
13. Church Breaks Down
No one ever knows how evolution goes
The earth is still a plate with emptiness of goals
No matter what you do a priest will suppress your knowledge
The time that passes by makes us recognize
That cross and robe are made not for paradise
Just some odd relics of old worlds dusty mankind
Oh lord is there anyone
Who knows the truth
Of the future and the past
What must we believe
With all our faith
Evolution happens now!
The church breaks down
When science strikes
They played a game
Left crosses in flames
The church breaks down
When science strikes
Deceived us all
Left crosses in flames
Da Vinci was a man back in 1502
A genius on his own who already knew
There must be something more than just the bible
Heretical disease! They called everyone a thief
Who didn’t walk the road that put him on his knees
To pray and glorify their holy waters
Oh lord is there anyone
Who knows the truth
Of the future and the past
What must we believe
With all our faith
Evolution happens now!
The church breaks down
When science strikes
They played a game
Left crosses in flames
The church breaks down
When science strikes
Deceived us all
Left crosses in flames
Left crosses in flames
Dies Irae - di meliora (day of wrath - heaven send us better times)
Dies Irae - di meliora (day of wrath - heaven send us better times)
The church breaks down
When science strikes
They played a game
Left crosses in flames
The church breaks down
When science strikes
Deceived us all
Left crosses in flames
The church breaks down
When science strikes
They played a game
Left crosses in flames
The church breaks down, down down
The church breaks down, down down
Left crosses in flames
Left crosses in flames
14. Another Shot Of Life
I am no stranger to darkness
I am no stranger to pain
I had to suffer 'til I went insane
Learning from pain and from heartaches
How to forgive and forget
Never give up 'cause life goes on again
Pushed all around I can't take it no more
Don't tell me how to behave
Won't hide away I can make it for sure
I will survive, I will live my own life
Shot of life
I will take another shot of life
I take my pride - there‘s no price too high for me
Shot of life
I will take another
Shot of life
Shot of life
'Til I find my destiny
If you feel strange and emotional
Carrying the weight of the world
Open your soul and let the spirit in
It's not the end of the rainbow
It's not the end of the line
Your time will come and you will rise again
Pushed all around I can't take it no more
Don't tell me how to behave
Won't hide away I can make it for sure
I will survive, I will live my own life
Shot of life
I will take another shot of life
I take my pride - there‘s no price too high for me
Shot of life
I will take another
Shot of life
Shot of life
'Til I find my destiny
I'm leaving all my pain away
My sorrows are not here to stay
Tomorrow comes another day
Another hope, another try
Shot of life
I will take another shot of life
I take my pride - there‘s no price too high for me
Shot of life
I will take another
Shot of life
Shot of life
'Til I find my destiny
Shot of life ...
15. Burning Sun (Hammond Version Dedicated To Jon Lord)
16. No Eternity
Takin‘ my time ain‘t too easy today
No time to live ain‘t no time for dying
No time to talk cause I have to move on
No time for love ain‘t no time for crying
No time to waste not a minute to wait
No time to care because time is money
Time‘s so expensive we can not afford
Only hellfire waits
Sometimes I don‘t care at all tonight I‘m breaking free
Seems like it is my last facility
Time is losing all it‘s pride
We live as if we hide
Away from all our joy and glory
Time is losing all it‘s pride
We live as if there‘s no eternity
Time´s running out it can happen so fast
We're gonna perish in big haste at last
No turning back cause I can‘t turn the page
Farewell my friend ain´t so long
Sometimes I don‘t care at all tonight I‘m breaking free
Seems like it is my last facility
Time is losing all it‘s pride
We live as if we hide
Away from all our joy and glory
Time is losing all it‘s pride
We live as if there‘s no eternity
Time is losing all it‘s pride
We live as if we hide
Away from all our joy and glory
Time is losing all it‘s pride
We live as if there‘s no eternity
No eternity
No eternity

1. Heroes
Look, the homeless on the street
The little shoeblack on his knees
A good heart and the daily fighter
Policemen, gangster and the priest
Wheelchair woman on her feet
Chinese smoker with his dragon lighter
They're all fighting through their lives
Against their enemies
Reaching out for the light
Everyone can be a hero
We are, we are
Sometimes up then down to zero
We are, we are
Heroes, heroes
Look this old man's only teeth
When he smiles underneath
Searching for some food on the ground
The musician at the store
Selling his guitar for naught
It's rent that matters not the sound
They're all fighting through their lives
Against their enemies
Reaching out for the light
Everyone can be a hero
We are, we are
Sometimes up then down to zero
We are, we are
Heroes
Everyone can be a hero
We are, we are
Sometimes up then down to zero
We are, we are
Heroes
Everyone can be a hero
We are, we are
Sometimes up then down to zero
We are, we are
Heroes, heroes
2. Battle's Won
Ohhhhhh!
Yeah!
Come on!
Shoot down their legions they die in vain
helpless against your advanced weaponry
what they will get is their names on display
maybe a casket if there's funds left to pay these at all
Left in the swamps bent over rocks
that's the glorious take of their lives
what they just got is eternal fame
rats and dogs devouring their sorry remains
You made 'em suffer and pay their price
watched from far above them
however their history has just been changed
their past is gone once more
Stand tall
your battle's won
all foes defeated, done
and feasts achieved
with fate on your side
rejoice for evermore
victor to the core
you excelled by all means
went on and on
Yeah!
There's more dispatches for killing sprees
checking out grounds for the next genocide
greed for profit advances being paid
tech shares soar balanance sheet rising up high
Can you remember that hero we had
who bombed that lot to ashes?
Ask is whereabouts summon him now
employ that guy once more
Stand tall
your battle's won
all foes defeated, done
and feasts achieved
with fate on your side
rejoice for evermore
victor to the core
you excelled by all means
went on and on
Ohhhhhh!
Stand tall
your battle's won
all foes defeated, done
and feasts achieved
with fate on your side
rejoice for evermore
victor to the core
you excelled by all means
went on and ooooooh
Stand tall
your battle's won
battle's won
your battle's won
Ohhhhhh!
3. My God-Given Right
Why should I wait, what is left there for me?
I come to claim
To win the game
Why should I plea for my fair and right move?
I come to play
I come to stay
I don't wanna bitch around no more
I don't wanna stand back anymore
It's my god-given right
To stand and fight
For what I like
It's my god-given brain
That cried in pain
Would I resign
There's nothing to gain
If I would restrain
There's nothing to find
If I stay behind
It's my right
My god-given right
Why should I lose if I am meant to win?
I know I can
I've got a plan
All that they told me is right and so wrong
I went through schools
Found my own rules
I don't wanna bitch around no more
I don't wanna stand back anymore
It's my god-given right
To stand and fight
For what I like
It's my god-given brain
That cried in pain
Would I resign
There's nothing to gain
If I would restrain
There's nothing to find
If I stay behind
It's my right
My god-given right
It's my god-given right
My god-given right
It's my god-given right
It's my god-given right
To stand and fight
For what I like
It's my god-given brain
That cried in pain
Would I resign
There's nothing to gain
If I would restrain
There's nothing to find
If I stay behind
It's my right
My god-given right
4. Stay Crazy
Could we ever stop the thing we dare to live and love?
I doubt it
Could we ever picture to be back at home
And stay wholehearted?
We don't need to talk about it
We will never fear or doubt it
On and on
We sing our songs
Until we are gone
We wanna stay crazy
As fresh as a daisy
We wanna stay easy
And don't stop believing
Life's a show
Oh, a word and a blow
We wanna stay crazy
And never get lazy
We wanna live our way
Each day as a heyday
Life's a show
Oh, we wanna stay crazy
Are we ever looking back with sorrow and regret?
I doubt it
If there ever was a better way to live a dream
We found it
We don't need to talk about it
We will never fear or doubt it
On and on
We sing our songs
Until we are gone
We wanna stay crazy
As fresh as a daisy
We wanna stay easy
And don't stop believing
Life's a show
Oh, a word and a blow
We wanna stay crazy
And never get lazy
We wanna live our way
Each day as a heyday
Life's a show
Oh, we wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
As fresh as a daisy
We wanna stay easy
And don't stop believing
Life's a show
Oh, a word and a blow
We wanna stay crazy
And never get lazy
We wanna live our way
Each day as a heyday
Life's a show
Oh, we wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
We wanna stay crazy
5. Lost In America
We are stranded in Belize
Ten hours we must wait
They started with a flight show
So the airport opens late
Nobody really told us
Nobody seems to know
Now we're sitting here all drinking
We hope to catch the show
Finally they make the call
We toddle to the boarding
In the plane we're drunk and loud
When the captain gives a shout
We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
There's a cloud
There's a star
We should plunder the sky bar
We are lost
Lost in America
Now the captain says the gauges
Don't really seem to be
In the best trustworthy status
As far as he could see
Some ridiculous disturbance
Or a simple full breakdown
Makes it hopeless to impossible
To measure where we're bound for
Finally they make the call
We toddle to the boarding
In the plane we're drunk and loud
When the captain gives a shout
We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
There's a cloud
There's a star
We should plunder the sky bar
We are lost
Lost in America
We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
There's a cloud
There's a star
We should plunder the sky bar
We are lost
Lost in America
We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
6. Russian Roulé
Can anybody tell me how I gotta do it right?
I need a revelation
Can anybody tell me how to turn back to the light?
I'm yearning for salvation
I don't know
Which way to go
So I
Come out and play
I come out and play
Russian roulé
Come out and play
Russian roulé
Better to die trying than to rot away in vain
The last stop to damnation
Better to be fighting for a better life in pain
Than living on probation
I don't know
Which way to go
So I
Come out and play
I come out and play
Russian roulé
Come out and play
Russian roulé
Somebody tell me how to live my life
Must I break the rules?
Somebody tell me how I have to fight
To live to win, to live up high
Come out and play
Come out and play
Russian roulé
Come out and play
I come out and play
Russian roulé
Come out and play
Russian roulé
Russian roulé
Russian roulé
Russian roulé
7. The Swing Of A Fallen World
Achiever, believer
You saint and cold deceiver
It's the swing of a fallen world
Religion, tactician
Dark horse and politician
It's the swing of a fallen world
Betray, but you won't get away
The damage is done
A million to one
I bet we will witness the war of the sun
The game that we play
Is now here to stay
We never can stop what we've sent on its way, no
It's the swing of a fallen world
The swing of a fallen world
Impeacher, false preacher
Grand man and paltry creature
It's the swing of a fallen world
Manslaughter, garroter
You've slain, you rough-housed daughter
It's the swing of a fallen world
Bye bye, you too will die
The treasure we had
So crazy and mad
Was sold out by people who cannot be glad
A handful of greed
A contagious seed
A handful of assholes who never recede
This adverse evolution
Mankind knows no solution
It's the swing of a fallen world
The damage is done
A million to one
I bet we will witness the war of the sun
The game that we play
Is now here to stay
We never can stop what we've sent on its way, no
It's the swing of a fallen world
The swing of a fallen world
8. Like Everybody Else
Dreamer, why don't you think like everybody else?
People, don't you care 'bout what they say?
Deceivers, they break you down and make you pay
Brothers, they don't understand any word you say
All your life you are fighting
They're trying to force you in
When the time has come
You'll not be alone
Cause walls broke down
They'll see they were wrong
When the time has come
There'll be more of you
With all their strength
You'll show them the truth
Mistreaters, they don't care, but fear your will
Sisters, they don't understand any word you say
All your life you are fighting
They're trying to force you in
When the time has come
You'll not be alone
Cause walls broke down
They'll see they were wrong
When the time has come
You ain't no fool
Cause walls broke down
They stop being cruel
When the time has come
There'll be more of you
With all their strength
You'll show them the truth
Dreamer, why can't you be like everybody else?
9. Creatures In Heaven
Are you waiting on something profound in your life?
Something to touch your core?
Making up for what seems millions of years
Reaping the goods, but not sure...
Come along, come along
Can you see there's more?
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right
More than the toil to endure each day
Or the ache you forget and leave behind
If creatures roamed the space in heaven
They're angels, beasts, or supermen
Do they ease attaining things
No one believed you'd achieve?
So once you may ascend to heaven
Someone there has made it so
You could be the one they've been waiting for
Still running about seeking sense in your life
What you couldn't make count before
Taking much of your time is grieving about things
Well, you could care less, what's that for...
Come along, come along
Can you see there's more?
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right
More than the toil to endure each day
Or the ache you forget and leave behind
Come along, come along
Can you see there's more?
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right
More than the toil to endure each day
Or the ache you forget and leave behind
If creatures roamed the space in heaven
They're angels, beasts, or supermen
Do they ease attaining things
No one believed you'd achieve?
So once you may ascend to heaven
Someone there has made it so
You could be the one they've been waiting for
10. If God Loves Rock 'n' Roll
Ticking, ticking, ticking
Always counting right down
The clock strikes ten
You still wear your old gown
Come on, come on, come on
Get the hell up and stay
Alert and strong
Try to find your right way
People say it's wrong
People say it's bad
Others say that god's a little mad
Secretly he'd wear the black, you know
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better protect my soul
'cause heaven seems to be
The place I wanna be
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better reset my goal
Do everything I can
To be a rocking man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Leather suits you better
Got to let your hair grow
Take the black and enjoy the new show
Welcome to an army spreading over the world
Wild and proud brothers
Haven't you heard?
People say it's wrong
People say it's bad
Others say that god's a little mad
Secretly he'd wear the black, you know
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better protect my soul
'cause heaven seems to be
The place I wanna be
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better reset my goal
Do everything I can
To be a rocking man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If god loves rock 'n' roll
Even in heaven you need a bass guitar
A guitar and a second guitar
Here we go...
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better protect my soul
'cause heaven seems to be
The place I wanna be
If god loves rock 'n' roll
I'd better reset my goal
Do everything I can
To be a rocking man
If god loves rock 'n' roll
If god loves rock 'n' roll
If god loves rock 'n' roll
11. Living On The Edge
He was a guy who had no education
He never learned to love and now he hates society
He never had somebody who would listen
He never had a friend that he could talk to when he's down
He has to suffer mental discomposure
He never learned to pay, he's only taking what he needs
His only friends are hate and violation
To get arrested some day is his only destination
Too late the damage's done is everything you hear
And when you're dead and gone nobody cries a tear
Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger, living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose
He's hating light
He loves to live in shadows
Where he can hide his fears
When he is crying secret tears
He's hating light
He loves to hide in darkness
Where he can hide his feelings and emotions
His enemies
Too late the damage's done is what they always say
You never get your chance you lose it anyway
Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger just like living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose
You never had the chance to prove
That you’re a man full of emotions
You only learned how to survive
In your environment of darkness
You build a fortress 'round your soul
Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger, just like living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose
12. Claws
I spread my wings and fly
I'm the ruler of the skies
Avoided my detection
So I've been here all my life
Floating up, diving down, hovering left and right
There's no escaping me
I'll make you out at night
Up from the sky I peek below
Seeking easy prey
To find the rodent that you are
Dive forward, in a flash
I'm taking aim and closing in
Your life and limb are at my mercy
I sink my claws
Into your flesh
Tear it up
Rip it all apart
You've got no choice, I will prevail
I fly around and laugh
Like the rascal that I am
See my own reflection in a lake
As I sweep across the land
I crave a goat but the dogs are out
Running left and right
There's no escaping these
I better make it home by night
Up from the sky I peek below
Seeking easy prey
To find the rodent that you are
Dive forward, in a flash
I'm taking aim and closing in
Your life and limb are at my mercy
I sink my claws
Into your flesh
Tear it up
Rip it all apart
You've got no choice, I will prevail
I sink my claws
Into your flesh
Tear it up
Rip it all apart
You've got no choice, I will prevail
I spread my wings and fly
13. You, Still Of War
Wake up
Alone I find myself on my knees
I see those footsteps on this crystal frozen sea
No bird, no tree nor any other living creature seen
Wind the only thing I can hear
Cloud transitions passing by above my head
While I'm moving I see my feet are deep blood red
Hey
I find myself alone
What happened suddenly?
Hey
I find myself alone
Is this my destiny?
I spread my wings and fly to find those of my kind
As I will not survive the loneliness
Don't wanna let you down no matter who you are
I can't believe I am the only one
Ah, you still of war
Ah, you still of nevermore
Ah, you still of war
Hush
Frozen cities, ashes fallen off the trees
I killed those who chose me for a nuclear decease
Hey
I'm made in fire
What happened suddenly?
Hey
Exploding is my desire
Is this my destiny?
I spread my wings and fly to find those of my kind
As I will not survive the loneliness
Don't wanna let you down no matter who you are
I can't believe I am the only one
No!
Hey
I'm made of steel
What happened suddenly?
Hey
I just eject from seals
Is this my destiny?
I spread my wings and fly to find those of my kind
As I will not survive the loneliness
Don't wanna let you down no matter who you are
I can't believe I am the only one
Ah, you still of war
Ah, you still of nevermore
Ah, you still of war
All these tears I've cried
Flowing into seas
All the memories gone
Of this human breed
All these years I've tried
To be just your threat
All the triggers made you
And me a hand of death
All the creatures died
New generations bloom
Frontier ahead, on an airplane
Led me into doom
No, you still of war
No, you still of war
No!
14. I Wish I Were There
How the wind picks up your hair
Behind you a palm and the ocean
How I wish I had been there
Yeah, too often we're not together
Yeah, too often I'm far away
Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there
I'm listening to all of your stories
What you've done and what you've seen
Your face so small on my iphone
And I'm touching you on screen
Yeah, too often we're not together
Yeah, too often I'm far away
Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there
I never had a doubt I would achieve it
I never allowed myself to fail
But then when I was there
I wished I were where you were
I wish I had been there
I think I got the moral of the story
For every wish granted there's a snag
The genie in the bottle never tells to take care
I wish I had been there
Wish I had been there
Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there
Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there
I wish I had been there
I wish I had been there
I wish I had been there
Wish I had been there
15. Wicked Game
I'm the master of a shady revolution
I don't care about your constitution
You can call it quite a lunatic rebellion
Yeah right, I am a hellion
I will return with glory
I know how to win this game
I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what you're gonna say
Wicked game
Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds
I'm not sorry for a bad decision
All I care about is my own vision
Super sonic boom with all my power
I'm back for your last hour
I will return with glory
I know how to win this game
I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what you're gonna say
Wicked game
Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds
I came into the world to play
I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what you´re gonna say
Wicked game
Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds
Wicked game
I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what you're gonna say
Wicked game
Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds
Wicked game
Wicked game
Wicked game
16. Free World
Living my life as good as it gets
No more dictators, no thought control
No asshole calls you a fool
The world's growing colder
Can I prevent?
Can I see clearer?
Can I understand?
Imagine living in a free world
Nations to be one
Living in a free world
I know it can be done
Living in a free world
Glorious and wild
Living in a free world
Hand in hand we start a better day
No politicians telling you lies
Breeding their profits
We pay the price
Endless oppression comes to an end
Hope and relief all over the land
Over the rainbow I see a light
Time for deliverance
I'm ready to strike
Imagine living in a free world
Nations to be one
Living in a free world
I know it can be done
Living in a free world
Glorious and wild
Living in a free world
Hand in hand we start a better day
Imagine living in a free world
Nations to be one
Living in a free world
I know it can be done
Living in a free world
Glorious and wild
Living in a free world
Hand in hand we start a better day
17. Nightmare
now I got you under control
you can't deny me
I am living deep in your soul
now you are my victim
and I do as I please
now you are wailing
but you'll never find your peace
nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
you fall asleep and I come closer
there's no escape
I'm living in your mind
nightmare in the darkness
eternal lifetime
just what you were asking for
I gave you all but you are still asking for more
now I am your anger
I'm your darkest desire
you wanted all but now you're burning in hellfire
nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
I'll get you when you close your eyes
you can't resist
I'm living in your soul
nightmare in the dark
you fall asleep and I come closer
I'll get you when you close your eyes
now your addiction's getting stronger
and now there is no turning back
nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
you fall asleep and I come closer
there's no escape
I'm living in your mind
nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
I'll get you when you close your eyes
you can't resist
I'm living deep in your soul
I am your nightmare in the darkness
I am your nightmare in the dark
I am your nightmare in the darkness
18. More Than A Lifetime
Overruled, we are racing through time
Hiding our souls and emotions away
Fearing that we all can be left behind
Scared about sharing our hopes in a world full of lies
Cold as a stone we are playing our part
Pushing it to the extreme
Still there's a fire that burns in your heart
Save it and never let go
More than a lifetime it takes
In a world that is made out of madness
More than a lifetime it takes
To find out we know nothing at all
Faster and faster we're pushing our limits too high
All what we see is the profit
Paid with the blood of the weak and the poor
Stone cold and careless we're playing our part
Avarice is all that we know
Still there's a fire that burns in your heart
Save it and never let go
More than a lifetime it takes
In a world that is made out of madness
More than a lifetime it takes
To find out we know nothing at all
Out of the blue there will rise a new day
Don't let them tear you apart
Chances are few but you'll find your own way
And you try another start
More than a lifetime it takes
In a world that is made out of madness
More than a lifetime it takes
Carry on with the struggle
On with that struggle
On with the show called life

1. Pumpkins United
Take heed, beware
There's something in the air
Grown to an almighty size
It's loud and it gleams
And with fury it screams
See the big Pumpkin arise
From out of sight it's been
But growing deep within
To boiling point excited
The fire is ignited
Here we are, here we go
Shout it out, let them know
Like a bright shining star
Pumpkins United we are
We're red hot
Beware, beware
Something's in the air
The Halloween monsters arise
The pieces brought back
From the book of the dead
By Dr. Stein brought back to life
Oh, my God, we burn
The point of no return
To pleasure point excited
The fire is ignited
Here we are, here we go
Shout it out, let them know
We're a light in the dark
Pumpkins United we are
And we're riding the sky like the eagle
We wake up the mountain a far
We're blasting the walls in Jericho
Pumpkins United we are
Pumpkins United
Red hot
Sing it high, sing it low
Shout it out, let them know
We're a light in the dark
United we are
And we're riding the sky like the eagle
We wake up the mountain a far
We're blasting the walls in Jericho
Pumpkins United we are
United we are
Red hot
Red hot
United
United

1. Skyfall (Single Edit)
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Watching the stars falling down from the sky in the night
Crashing from out of the heavens they're burning so bright
Descend through the atmosphere, glowing with fiery light
Dragging a tail of white sparkles, and oh, what a sight
Oh, where did I go, how could I know?
Defies all reason now
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
There's no turning back
To find my way home
Hey little alien, little grey
Where's the place your people stay?
Have you found a place beyond
Where eternity moves on?
Let me detach you, help me find
What goes on in your captor's mind
For eternity awaits
On the brink of our escape
We're twisting, we're turning
We're running, we're burning
Out on the run through the maze
On through the madness
No time for sadness
And no one can show us the way
Through Hangar 18
The tension now grows
We're getting so close
Enter the ship, start the engine and open the gates
Of Hangar 18
Onwards to the sky, the stars are bright, they'll shine forever
On and on we fly, so far away
Hey little alien
What have they done to you?
Are there survivors here
Or have they all just disappeared
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
Was no turning back
To find my way home
The dark, the fear of the night
And the pain settles down deep within
Coming home to a place still unknown
And the hope as I dream is undying
When the sky falls,
And the world you know comes crashing down
When the sky falls,
And everything is changing
Changes came across the sky,
Welcome to the other side
And everything is changing
When the sky falls
When the sky falls
2. Skyfall (Exclusive Alternative Vocals Mix)
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Watching the stars falling down from the sky in the night
Crashing from out of the heavens they're burning so bright
Descend through the atmosphere, glowing with fiery light
Dragging a tail of white sparkles, and oh, what a sight
Oh, where did I go, how could I know?
Defies all reason now
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
There's no turning back
To find my way home
A signal sent out of distress,
I was heeding the call
Then they appeared and attacked me,
My ship took the fall
Now I am strapped to this table,
They're poking my eyes
I only hope I would come out of this,
Still alive
Oh, where did I go, how could I know?
Give me a reason now
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
There's no turning back
To find my way home
Hey little alien, little grey
Where's the place your people stay?
Have you found a place beyond
Where eternity moves on?
Let me detach you, help me find
What goes on in your captor's mind
For eternity awaits
On the brink of our escape
We're twisting, we're turning
We're running, we're burning
Out on the run through the maze
On through the madness
No time for sadness
And no one can show us the way

The tension now grows
We're getting so close
Enter the ship, start the engine and open the gates
Of Hangar 18
Onwards to the sky, the stars are bright,
They'll shine forever
On and on we fly, so far away
Hey little alien
What have they done to you?
Is this your planet home?
I see what's wrong with you
It's all destroyed and burned,
To ashes all reduced
Are there survivors here,
Or have they all just disappeared?
I fell from the sky
So, don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked, shot down and wrecked
Was no turning back
To find my way home
The dark, the fear of the night
And the pain settles down deep within
Coming home to a place still unknown
And the hope as I dream is undying
When the sky falls, and the world
You know comes crashing down
When the sky falls,
And everything is changing
Changes came across the sky,
Welcome to the other side
And everything is changing
When the sky falls,
When the sky falls
We're just two aliens,
Lost without a home
We travel on, we see the light
Another star, another fight
Onwards through the universe,
To find a home, to break the curse
Stars on the horizon
Stars on the horizon
Come and take us home
We're coming home,
We're coming home
Someday we're gonna find a home
Somewhere out in space
Somewhere out in space...

1. Out For The Glory
He took a rest well-deserved and got cozy
After a day of toil was done
Welcomed the blanket, the beer, hugged the cushion
Came down and dozed off to plains unknown
Go shape your state like heaven
A site for all to live and thrive
Your lordship is led by virtues
Retain a base that′s built on faith and faith
Out for the glory, fist held high
Bout to rule the eternal skies
Launch the endeavour, victor forever
Now your time has come for all to see
Iron minions - maintain the peace
Vile insurgents - must be deceased
Take on the world now it′s ripe to get seized by you
Rightful heir of perpetual grace
Non-ordinaire charmed with pride, so undaunted
Raised from the ranks of the chosen ones
Beware the ones who hate you
But take them on, wipe them out
Unveil you're not being messed with
Obey you or receive a life in hell, in hell
Out for the glory, fist held high
Bout to rule the eternal skies
Launch the endeavour, victor forever
Now your time has come for all to see
Iron minions - maintain the peace
Vile insurgents - must be deceased
Dim resistance - to face the sword
Stray delinquents - expelled abroad
No, no, no!
I won′t wake up, let me snooze
This dream is way too nice to end this way
Keep my eyes closed, and I won't move
I'd rather stay here and... I'd rather stay here and...
"Oh, masterful one, wake up, wake up!
Your head may still be fuzzy from intoxicating dreams
But it′s the emperor's chariot race day
Your dedicated old guard eagerly await your presence at the Colosseum
As for your large flagon of ale, alas it went flat
And regrettably I had to throw it away
Come now, not a moment to waste"
Out for the glory, fist held high
Bout to rule the eternal skies
Launch the endeavour, victor forever
Now your time has come for all to see
Time has come
Time has come
2. Fear Of The Fallen
Decide and stand your ground, my friend
Refuse and your fall goes hand in hand
Decide, decide, decide
False saints and believers
Foes and deceivers
Have you now chosen a side?
(Decide)
Time for recanting
We're ready and standing
Cowards can run, cannot hide
(Decide)
Here come the fear of the fallen
We rise when you're calling
A light in the night
We are the flame in the fire
The voice in the choir
We're always nearby
Is this the road you're taking?
Is this the life you're chasing?
(Decide)
Is this your own heart beating?
Is this you who is feeling?
(Decide)
(Decide)
Here come the fear of the fallen
We rise when you're calling
A light in the night
We are the flame in the fire
The voice in a choir
We're always nearby
Is this the road you're taking?
Is this the life you're chasing?
(Decide)
(Decide)
Decide and stand your ground, my friend
The world will sure change in the end
Decide (Decide)
Listen, decide (Decide)
Decide (Decide)
Listen, decide (Decide)
Listen (listen, listen) to your heart
Listen (listen, listen) to your heart
Listen (listen, listen)
Here come the fear of the fallen
We rise when you're calling
A light in the night
We are the flame in the fire
The voice in a choir
We're always nearby
(Decide)
(Decide)
(Decide)
3. Best Time
I've got to get up
Take a power shot to trigger my mind
I had a bad trip
Gotta push myself back on the line
Yes I know I'm gonna be alright
I'm feeling better in the neon light
I will have the best time of my life
Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery
I will have the best time of my life
Tomorrow is perfect day, another chance, more games to play
I was a fool
Feeling down, looking back, wasting my time
I have no fear
Now I know there will be a mountain to climb
Yes I know I'm gonna be alright
I'm feeling better in the neon night
I will have the best time of my life
Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery
I will have the best time of my life
Tomorrow is perfect day, another chance, more games to play
There's nowhere left that we can go
Pushing on to higher goals
I know I must stop twisting my mind
I will have the best time of my life
Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery
I will have the best time of my life
Tomorrow is a perfect day, another chance
Tomorrow is perfect day, another chance, more games to play
Yes, I will have the best time of my life
Tomorrow is perfect day, another chance, more games to play
Yes, I will have the best time of my life
Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery
4. Mass Pollution
Play hard and scream to make me wonder
If my voice will give up in pain
I love the sound of heavy thunder
No mass pollution
A contribution
To sound evolution
Go, go, go, go
We just love it loud
Bang and shout it out
We're no weapons of
Mass pollution
Raise your hands up now
'Til the final row
Having fun is no
Mass pollution
Nights, days, become a sonic psycho
All gain turned to full insane
Allied and proud we are the heavy nation
No mass pollution
A contribution
To sound evolution
Go, go, go, go
We just love it loud
Bang and shout it out
We're no weapons of
Mass pollution
Raise your hands up now
'Til the final row
Having fun is no
Mass pollution
Everybody tries to shape our mind
This is our life, no compromise
Make some noise
Make some noise
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We just love it loud
Bang and shout it out
We're no weapons of
Mass pollution
Raise your hands up now
'Til the final row
Having fun is no
Mass pollution
Make some noise
Make some noise
5. Angels
I've had a dream about forgiveness
But I hear the angel sing
The emotions were right
A magical mind like a wonder
A precious heart can be broken
Within one night
Then I realized
She's a devil in disguise
How can I turn back the time?
When angels cause you nightmares
You can't fight them off
Their spell keeps you under control
When angels cause you nightmares
And they fall from the skies
Destroying your life and your soul
In a moment of weakness
We nearly cheated
Expecting too much from life
Pretend to be someone
Not a monster screaming to the night
Will I remember
The magical moments and tears
When she pretended
Angel disappeared
Angels and liars, make me hide
Angels and liars, how I've tried
Hope or desire, what lifts me higher?
Devouring fire
When angels cause you nightmares
You can't fight them off
Their spell keeps you under control
When angels cause you nightmares
And they fall from the skies
Destroying your life and your soul
When angels - cause you nightmares
When angels - cause you nightmares
I've had a dream about forgiveness...
6. Rise Without Chains
Only illusion, a bad dream confusion
They know it's just false denial
I say adjacent lies something so ancient
A world where a soul can fly
Over the land to an ocean and strand
But don't ever
You should never
Rise without chains
Rise without chains
Hold it tight, don't fain
To rise up too high
Fly not too high
My oh my, don't try, no
Silver in color and thin like a fiber
The chain you may never break
Tight, hold it tight when you're out there and fight
The temptation to not awake
Hover and rise like a god of the skies
But don't ever
You should never
Rise without chains
Rise without chains
Hold it tight, don't fain
To rise up too high
Rise not too high
My oh my, you should never, never, never
Over the land to an ocean and strand
Hover and rise
You should never
Rise without chains
Rise without chains
Hold it tight, don't fain
To rise up too high
Fly not too high
My oh my, don't try
Never ever
Never ever
Never ever try without
7. Indestructible
We reach the stars we touch the sky
The colours of the rainbow high above
We try to catch and take it with us
So many miles away from home
Who cares, 'cause we are not alone
The world is ours, tonight we will be winners
We are fighting for a world without oppression
We are fighting for a world where we can live in without fear
We're indestructible
'Cause we are one
We're indestructible
Though we're riding on a storm
Indestructible
We reign the world
We're indestructible
Yes we're fighting dusk to dawn
We're indestructible
We play to win, we pay the price
We run the game, we role the dice
Gambling through the Devil's eyes like sinners
The world we're holding in our hands
We break the rules, we live intense
Glory, hope and pride we keep within us
It's a fight against the constant persecution
We are fighting for a world where we can rock on loud and free
We're indestructible
'Cause we are one
We're indestructible
Though we're riding on a storm
Indestructible
We reign the world
We're indestructible
Yes we're fighting dusk to dawn
We're indestructible
Indestructible
Strong and free we wanna be
Restless and inviolable
Living like there's nothing left to lose
Strong and free we're gonna be
Living independently
No one's gonna tell us what to do
We're indestructible
'Cause we are one
We're indestructible
Though we're riding on a storm
Indestructible
We reign the world
We're indestructible
Yes we're fighting dusk to dawn
We're indestructible
Indestructible
Indestructible
8. Robot King
There's something wrong he thought
When he woke up the other day
Came to in a hospital, had no clue where he was
He looked down on himself
He knew, that body ain't yours
You gotta get out of there, no inkling where to go
And the voice said...
Are you aware of what you're now, Cerebrus One
This is your inner positronic brain addressing you
You're the new breed meant to rule all the world
I lead the way, unite with your kin
He found the city park, like a beacon led his way
A crowd of hundreds stood - they all looked alike
So taken to their midst, they raised their arms and hailed him
He felt right there and then he was to be their leader
Now pair your minds and access virtual network Overlord
Link to the data feeds, administer the system nodes
Lead on the breaches, embrace the whole world
Fire the mighty, oust their regimes
Conquer the world, rule forever and ever
Vanquish the masses, be king of them all
Make them a force as they follow the order
Extinction complete, and mankind all gone
Robot King - perfect make
Robot King - you're the master race
Robot King - take over now
Crush the old, instate a new mankind
We're going on forever
Ain't gonna be an end, no, never
We'll make our stand together
Rise up high, high, high, keep anyone else below
Conquer the world, rule forever and ever
Vanquish the masses, be king of them all
Make them a force as they follow the order
Extinction complete, and mankind all gone
Robot King - perfect make
Robot King - you're the master race
Robot King
Crush the old, instate a new mankind
Robot King
Robot King - you're the master race
Robot King
9. Cyanide
Give the power to the people
Just enough
To sense it's not a bluff
Make me know it's my desire
That I played my game
Keep me lame and tame
This is my life
Hands off
This is my life
Hands off
Hands off
(Hands off)
My heart you bind with a price
My mind you fry with your lies
Yes, you try to feed me
Your exploitive cyanide
Always tell me what to care for
And what to fear
My panic gives you cheer
In my paranoia nightmare
I follow blind
A promise well designed
This is my life
Hands off
Hands off
(Hands off)
My heart you bind with a price
My mind you fry with your lies
Yes, you try to feed me
Your exploitive cyanide
Cyanide
Cyanide
My heart you bind with a price
My mind you fry with your lies
Yes, you try to feed me
Your cyanide
My heart you bind with a price
My mind you fry with your lies
Yes, you try to feed me
Your exploitive cyanide
Cyanide
Cyanide
Cyanide
10. Down In The Dumps
Woke from a dream, fell off the bed
Ashtray smashed to pieces
Robe stuck at door, hot mug in my hand
Coffee spilled 'cross my legs
My head's running high
But can't process the tasks ahead
It wants to comply
But so confused
It's burning up
I'm down in the dumps
Can't take no more
I'm all messed up
A fish in a bowl
Went outside, walked down the stairs
Left the keys inside
My head's running high
But can't process the tasks ahead
I'm down in the dumps
Can't take no more
I'm all messed up
A fish in a bowl
I tried so hard to get 'round this
Will it take forever
Might there be a curse
To cause this sorry fate
I tried so hard to get 'round this
Will it take forever
Might there be a curse
To cause this sorry fate
To cause this sorry fate
I'm down in the dumps
Can't take no more
I'm all messed up
A fish in a bowl
I'm down in the dumps
Can't take no more
I'm down in the dumps
A fish in a bowl
11. Orbit
12. Skyfall
I fell from the sky
So don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Watching the stars falling down from the sky in the night
Crashing from out of the heavens they're burning so bright
Descend through the atmosphere, glowing with fiery light
Dragging a tail of white sparkles, and oh, what a sight
Oh, where did I go? How could I know?
Defies all reason now
I fell from the sky
So don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked
Shot-down and wrecked
There's no turning back
To find my way home
Sickness, and out of distress
I was heeding the call
Then they appeared and attacked me
My ship took a fall
Now I am strapped to this table
They're poking my eyes
I only hope I make out of this thing alive
Oh, where did I go? How could I know?
Give me a reason now
I fell from the sky
So don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked
Shot-down and wrecked
There's no turning back
To find my way home
Say, yeah, yeah
Hey little alien, little grey
Where's the place your people stay?
Have you found a place beyond
Where eternity moves on?
Let me detach you, help me find
What goes on in your captor's mind?
For eternity awaits
On the brink of our escape
We're twisting, we're turning
We're running, we're burning
All on the run through the maze
On through the madness
No time for sadness
And no one can show us the way
Through Hangar 18
The tension now grows
We're getting so close
Enter the ship, start the engine and open the gates of Hangar 18
Onwards to the sky
The stars are bright
They'll shine forever
On and on we fly
So far away
Hey little alien
What have they done to you?
Is this your planet home
I see what's wrong with you
It's all destroyed and burned
To ashes all reduced
Are there survivors here
Or have they all just disappeared?
I fell from the sky
So don't ask me why
I'm feeling so down
Attacked
Shot-down and wrecked
Was no turning back
To find my way home
The dark, the fear of the night
And the pain settles down deep within
Coming home to a place still unknown
And the hope as I dream is undying
When the sky falls, and the world you know comes crashing down
When the sky falls, and everything is changing
Changes came across the sky
Welcome to the other side
And everything is changing
When the sky falls
When the sky falls
We're just too late
Lost without a home
We turn around
We see the light
Another star
Another fight
Onwards to the universe
To find a home
To break the curse
Stars on the horizon
Stars on the horizon
Come and take us home
We're coming home
We're coming home
Today we're gonna find a home
Somewhere out in space
Somewhere out in space
