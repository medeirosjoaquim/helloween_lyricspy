1. Invitation (Intro)
2. Eagle Fly Free
People are in big confusion
they don't like their constitutions
everyday they draw conclusions
and they're still prepared for war
Some can say what's ineffective
some make up themselves attractive
build up things they call protective
well your life seems quite bizarre
In the sky a mighty eagle
doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
on its wings the rainbow's light
it's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free
let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind
follow the sign
together we'll fly someday
Hey, we think so supersonic
and we make our bombs atomic
or the better quite neutronic
but the poor don't see a dime
Nowadays the air's polluted
ancient people persecuted
that's what mankind contributed
to create a better time
In the sky a mighty eagle
doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
on its wings the rainbow's light
it's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free
let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind
follow the sign
together we'll fly someday
3. You Always Walk Alone
When I hold the key to open heaven's door
I will never make the mistake and give it back
when I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late
I will never give it back
There's just one way I see
the way I think it's right for me
you say to me I will repent what I do
if it's right I'll stop before
When I see the light of sun will fade away
And I reveal what I have loved before
it's too late when I can't see the hours I pay
and I reveal what I have loved before
There's just one way I see
the way I think it's right for me
you say to me I will repent what I do
if it's right I'll stop before
The life I try to give is
all I have inside of me
it's one kind of life for me
this music you hear
the strength we have inside is
so much more than you will know
but if you can't see the life around
you'll always walk alone
Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes
see his strong hands
but tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
see the drunk man, try to ask him why
he will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie
there's a fight in his head he cannot win
getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin
You--you cannot hide
You--you cannot describe your feelings inside
The life I try to give is
all I have inside of me
it's one kind of life for me
this music you hear
the strength we have inside is
so much more than you will know
but if you can't see the life around
you'll always walk alone
4. Rise And Fall
Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit
everyone could see him fall
and be sure it's been his last hit
he's never been seen at all
Some dictator felt progressive
and lay down in the sun
but his people were aggressive
they killed him with a gun
Sometimes you're wrong
by some things you have done
you see fate is too strong
nothing's won
no use for a fight
if you're not acting right
you'll be cut down to size
like a lie
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
so better use your brain
A little dragon could spit fire
but never so for something bad
he didn't know the knight's desire
to throw a lance into his head
Romeo loved his Juliet
their parents told them "Stop"
then it all turned out peculiar
he couldn't get it up
And it's all in vain
when you're living with pain
reap not goods you have grown
by your own
feelings you like
disappear overnight
you sip up every grin
free to win
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
you nearly go insane
A spaceman flies the rocket
that takes him to the stars
thinks his wife is in his pocket
but she's strolling 'round in bars
The king of Los Angeles
bought himself a teddy bear
and the queen became shameless
she did it with a chair
Sometimes you're wrong
by some things you have done
you see fate is too strong
nothing's won
no use for a fight
if you're not acting right
you'll be cut down to size
like a lie
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
so better use your brain
5. Dr. Stein
Once they killed his monster when it went into a trap
now he's making better ones on a higher step
On a warm summer day the doctor went away
to a place where he could make it real
his assistant's hips were nice
so he cloned her once or twice
now his hips are aching what a deal
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
lets them run into the night
they become
Sometimes when he's feeling bored
he's calling it a day
he's got his computers and they do it their own way
They mix some DNA, some skina and a certain spray
you can watch it on a laser screen
and the fellow's blue and grey
or sometimes pink and green
just check it out on Halloween
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures. . .
One night he cloned himself
put his brother on a shelf
but when he fell asleep that night
it crept up from behind and thought "well never mind"
took a syringe and blew out his life
6. We Got The Right
Don't turn your head
back to the wall
don't close your eyes
and wait for your fall
If you believe that you know in this time
you've got anything to win
if you believe that you know
then I say, "you'll lose all again"
In this time there's nothing to get for you
you cannot really do what you want
you're a child, a prisoner in your mind
you are a victim of this hopeless time
You better believe all you do has a sense
it's not for nothing
you better believe all the troubles you have
will play you someday
Why don't you help yourself and do the best
put all the bombs back up their builders' ass
why don't you stand up to say who you are
to show the people that paradise is not far
Oh, can't you see we got the right
to look into the future without no need to hide
no, we won't accept what you do
we stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse
oh, can't you see we got the right
to say we are here to see the light
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
We are credulous idiots
and won't understand what they plan
we march with the times
it's what they expect and we do
Why don't you open your eyes
to undercover all of these lies
I think you won't accept this
go oppose with your fist
fight for your rights
Oh, can't you see we got the right
to say we are here to see the light
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
7. Save Us
Too late to call for the priest
he is not here anymore
we look at the age of the beast
and we've seen its vast armies form
hear our call
Please, save us
please, save us
In permanent madness we live
no time for life and for love
to take is the rule, not to give
insanity comes from below
to take us all
Please, save us
please, save us
We believe that the phenomena of nature
are the expression of infinitive intelligence
we express our belief that all forms of life
are manifestations of spirit
and thus, all men are children of God
Far from down below one comes prepared to take us all
waiting for his future and the final call
We stand on the edge of the world
just one step more and we fall
guide us and please take our hands
without you we're weak and alone
hear our call
Please, save us
please, save us
Now!
Save us--from the gods of thunder
Save us--from the dogs of war
Save us--from the creeping nightmares
Save us--from the evil's course
Save us--from our own ignorance
Save us--from the man in black
Save us--from the desolation
Save us--from the hate attack
Save us--oh please
Save us--please save us
Save us--oh please
Save us--now!
8. March Of Time
Hours of lust, hours of tears passing by before my eyes
today, tomorrow, yesterday. . .one life
days of joy, day of sadness come and go to pass me by
a month, a year, one hundred years, they fly
Ohh, one day I will be gone to lead another life
ohh, and this world will stop to turn around with me
'cause
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally
Times of peace, times of fights, constant movement is our life
can't stop no more, not until. . .we die
we long for more. . .eternity, and maybe there's another life
this one is short, no matter how you try
Ohh, but never give up all the hope to lead a good life
no, don't waste your given time to make things worse
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
one without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally
Please, please help me see, the best way to be
make a change and we, live eternally
no more wasted years, no more wasted tears
life's too short to cry, long enough to try
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally
9. I Want Out
From our lives' beginning on
we are pushed in little forms
no one asks us how we like to be
in school they teach you what to think
but everyone says different things
but they're all convinced that
they're the ones to see
So they keep talking and they never stop
and at a certain point you give it up
so the only thing that's left to think is this
I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free
People tell me A and B
they tell me how I have to see
things that I have seen already clear
so they push me then from side to side
they're pushing me from black to white
they're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hear
But don't push me to the maximum
shut your mouth and take it home
'cause I decide the way things gonna be
I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free
There's a million ways to see the things in life
a million ways to be the fool
in the end of it, none of us is right
sometimes we need to be alone
No no no, leave me alone
I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free
10. Keeper Of The Seven Keys
Make the people
hold each other's hands
and fill their hearts with truth
you made up your mind
so do as divined
Put on your armour
ragged after fights
hold up your sword
you're leaving the light
make yourself ready
for the lords of the dark
they'll watch your way
so be cautious, quiet and hark
You hear them whispering
in the crowns of the trees
you're whirling 'round
but your eyes don't agree
will 'o' the wisps
misguiding your path
you can't throw a curse
without takin' their wrath
Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
or all us people forget what we've been
our only hope's your victory
kill that Satan who won't let us be--kill!
You're the keeper of the seven keys
that lock up the seven seas
and the seer of visions said before he went blind
hide them from demons and rescue mankind
or the world we're all in will soon be sold
to the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
You can feel cold sweat
running down your neck
and the dwarfs of falseness
throw mud at your back
Guided by spells
from the old seer's hand
you're suffering pain
only steel can stand
Stay well on your way and follow the sign
fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
the seven seas are far away
placed in the valley of dust heat and sway
You're the keeper of the seven keys
that lock up the seven seas
and the seer of visions said before he went blind
hide them from demons and rescue mankind
or the world we're all in will soon be sold
to the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
Throw the first key into the sea of hate
throw the second key into the sea of fear
throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
and make the people hold each other's hands
the fourth key belongs into the sea of greed
and the fifth into the sea of ignorance
Disease, disease, disease my friend
for this whole world's in devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease my friend
throw the key or you may die
On a mound at the shore of the last sea
he is sitting, fixing your sight
with his high iron voice causing sickness
he is playing you out with delight
man who do you just think you are?
a silly bum with seven stars
don't throw the key or you will see
dimensions cruel as they can be
don't let him suck off your power
throw the key. . .!
An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming, and earth swallowing him away!
You're the keeper of the seven keys
you locked up the seven seas
and the seer of visions can now rest in peace
there ain't no more demons and no more disease
and, mankind, live up, you're free again
yes the tyrant is dead, he is gone, overthrown
you have given our souls back to light
