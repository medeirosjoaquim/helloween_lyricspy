1. Irritation (Weik Editude 112 In C)
2. Sole Survivor
I got that fever
Burning my head
So many memories
No tear to shed
Burns like a fire
Who stole my aims?
My comrade fighters
Been sent astray
How could I know
What others had in mind for me?
How would they know
What measures I take?
Sole survivor
Of a kill without alert sing your feelings out
Your song remains unheard
Sole survivor
We shared like brothers
A light in the black
Totally blended
Bold and erect
But we've grown intriguers
Till it's too late
Time has brought fire
Fear, greed and hate
Now I'm cryin'
Shattered on the ground
All I find
Has died anyway
Sole survivor
Of a kill without alert sing your feelings out
Your song remains unheard
Sole survivor
Got a voice without a sound
Mean mistreaters
Took away your ground
Sole survivor
Sole survivor...
3. Where The Rain Grows
I never looked higher
Than I could see
Never gave less
Than I have given me
The more you have taken
You turned into fakes
I finally know how
Why for heavens'sake?
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that is someone's made dumb to the core
He would stay like before
So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
Now you call me liar
'Cause you are just the
"Always-have-right-
fools-majority"
I think that if someone
Starved at your side
You'd all turn your back
Won't give any dime
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that is someone's made sad to the core
He would stay like before
So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
I know where the rain grows
I'm back from where the rain grows
4. Why?
Father, it's time
Have a heart for your child who cries in pain
Not a new sign
But I strike that'll blow those fools away
Open your eyes
If you've got any you just look for too long a time
They spit on your name
Doin' everything you darnned as highest crime
They believe they could walk on the water
Playing 'god, sleep with the devils' daughter
Killed your son and might kill mine
But you don't mind
Why, Lord, why
Tell me why
In these lonely days
I'd need your answer
There's a reason why
How could you fail?
Still it's time, turn the black into the light
Why do you wait?
Do you look down and laugh at what you find?
Can't you see they are mistreating their daughters
They believe they could walk on the waters
They killed your son and might kill mine
But you don't mind
Why, Lord, why
Tell me why
In these lonely days
I'd need your answer
There's a reason why
Why, Lord, why
Tell me why
Your the only light
Forever lasting
Tell me, father, why
Why, Lord, why
Tell me why
In these lonely days
I'd need your answer
There's a reason why
Why, Lord, why
Tell me why
Your the only light
Forever lasting
Tell me, father, why
Father, it's time
Father, it's time...
5. Mr. Ego (Take Me Down)
Take me down
To the ground
Just let me feel it
If I let someone down
Please welcome
Him on the losing side
I shake you off
And make my choice
Don't wanna hear you
Your slimy voice
Please go down, please
I don't wanna feel you around me
Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin' down
I feel that man
On my back
Don't promise any crap
Someone will break your neck
You don't know how
To soak my soul
Let me out
Let me go
Open your eyes
You told nothing  but lies
Please go down, please
C'mon, go down with your ego
Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin' down
Let me go ahead, let me go
I will find an explanation
Where's my only destination
Separated ways now and forever
Is the only and only measure
Tales full of exaggerations
No more manipulations
And I think you are not funny
Your brain is just a bloated dummy
Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin' down
6. Perfect Gentleman
There is no doubt about it
I'm one of kind, baby
I am le d'Artagnan de coeur
As you may see, candy
And I'm talking with my eyes
And I walk in different styles
I'm the genuine man!
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Kneel down, inhale my odor
Come, kiss my hand, angel
Dare to explore my higher grounds
Strive to deserve me, ma cherie
And my winds surpass perfume
I'm charismatic at fool bloom,
I'm the genuine man
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am, I am, yes I am
(perfect)
Oh, Lord, what can I do?
I can't resist my own reflection
How would possibly anyone?
Cause I am (perfect)
Yes I am (perfect)
Oh, Lord,  I am (perfect)
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
7. The Game Is On
Have you seen this little toy
When you're down it gives you joy
You escape reality
Delve into its TV screen
For the rich and for the poor
For the even more secure
Doesn't matter where you are,
Where you go or when you been
Well, there's still no guarantee
For your virgin mind, you see
Just go on and play the game
You will surely go insane
The game is on
And you have gone
Gone to a world on its display
And the game is fun
But when it has won
All you ever hear is what it says
There's a great amount of fumes
Coming out from somebody's room
The firemen got there
Walking their way up the stairs
Find a man in a chair
But it doesn't seem he's there
With a grey box in his hands
He has gone to another land
The game is on
And you have gone
Gone to a world on its display
And the game is fun
But when it has won
All you ever hear is what it says
You have played it much too long
Now your senses get things strong
All your walls come crashing down
Now it's time for you to frown
How d'you like this heavy load?
Guess your brain will soon explode
You  never had this ugly feel
It's time to dial an emergency
8. Secret Alibi
Piece by piece you're tearin' me apart
Give to me and try another start
Brick by brick you really love this game
Things from which I can't refrain
So many stories have been told
I give a damn, they're much too old
How often will we face the end of our dreams?
When will I see it all come true?
A splendid time for me and you
Can we expect it bein' nice as it seems?
Will you be my secret alibi
Angel of my nights
Can we do it right?
Let's just try each others love so sweet
Till we can't deny my secret alibi
Ding by ding can you dig my dong
It may come short but it might come long
Limb by limb you're climbing on my tree
Making things more fun for me
So many stories I've been told
I give a damn, they're much too old
How often will we face the end of our dreams?
When will I see it all come true?
A splendid time for me and you
Can we expect it being nice as it seems?
Will you be my secret alibi
Angel of my nights
Can we do it right?
Let's just try each others love so sweet
Till we can't deny my secret alibi
Will you be my secret alibi
Angel of my nights
Can we do it right?
Let's just try each others love so sweet
Till we can't deny my secret alibi
9. Take Me Home
Now I'm here all alone
Takin' care of my own
Down in no man's land
Got no friend, got no dime
Only plenty of time
Where's the saving hand?
I got that feeling to need more and more attention
That is the fever, don't leave me alone
I got that feeling to make more than conversation
That is the fever, where's my home?
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
It's not true - what you see
Behind that mask that's not me
Try to reach my world
Can't you see I'm so blind
Stay with me to change my mind
No more nightmares, girl
I got that feeling to need more and more attention
That is the fever, don't leave me alone
I got that feeling to make more than conversation
That is the fever, where's my home?
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
I got that feeling to need more and more attention
That is the fever, don't leave me alone
I got that feeling to make more than conversation
That is the fever, where's my home?
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
10. In The Middle Of A Heartbeat
Tell me, pretty girl, do you know who I am?
Have you ever seen me as your friend?
Anything we have is those hungry nights
But there's so much left unsatisfied
All those little things you told me
Ain't good enough to show me
That we're gonna make it through the time
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm doin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart
Now that I'm afraid just to ask for more
I'm still waiting as I did before
If you only said that it's not too late
We could then rely upon our fate
All those little things you'd tell me
Could bear enough to show me
That we're gonna make it through the time
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm tellin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart
I found out
I found out
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm tellin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to br your light
I can't get any closer to your heart
11. Still We Go
In the beginning
Out of nowhere
We had a dream
And Now It's Helloween
Speed up to a higher limit
Change gear, we're losin' our spirit
We won't take your special advice
We are close to a metal breakdown
Sirens to warn of our meltdown
We couldn't see that headline
Now we can see a horizon
We're gonna be here to stay
If you cannot see our sign
You must be blind
Still we go
Still we go
Still we go
On the metal highway
Still we go
Warn out, won't die on our knees
Shine on, proud as we can be
Time has come to stop pleasing you
Hey man, Let's get it together
Our strength will last forever
Push us as far as we can go
Now we can see a horizon
We're gonna be here to stay
If you cannot see our sign
You must be blind
Still we go
Still we go
Still we go
On the metal highway
Still we go
How many times must a man cross the lines
To find his right way
Still we go
Still we go
Still we go
On the metal highway
Still we go
